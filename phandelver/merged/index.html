<h1 id="in-neverwinter">In Neverwinter</h1>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/neverwinter-city.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="neverwinter-city" src="../images/neverwinter-city.png" /></a></p>
<p>In the dimly lit Driftwood Tavern of Neverwinter, a group of adventurers found themselves brought together by fate. Mortimer, a studious mage with robes adorned with arcane symbols; Vaxidd, a stout and righteous dwarf, his armor bearing the proud insignia of Moradin; Orianna, a charismatic tiefling bard with a mischievous smile; and Sheod, a mysterious drow ranger, cloaked in shadows.</p>
<p>As they sat at a worn wooden table, sipping their drinks and discussing their past exploits, a burly dwarf with a bushy brown beard approached them. It was Gundren Rockseeker, a name whispered among adventurers for his reputation and wealth.</p>
<p>"Good evening, esteemed travelers," Gundren greeted them warmly, his voice carrying a touch of excitement. "I have a proposition for you, if you're willing to listen."</p>
<p>The group exchanged curious glances, their interest piqued by the dwarf's presence. Mortimer motioned for Gundren to take a seat at their table, inviting him to share his proposal.</p>
<p>"I need a group of capable escorts to ensure the safe delivery of a wagon filled with supplies to the town of Phandalin," Gundren began, his eyes flickering with a mix of anticipation and urgency. "My friend Sildar Hallwinter and I have important business to attend to there, and we can't afford any mishaps along the way."</p>
<p>Sheod leaned forward, his piercing gaze fixed on Gundren. "And what exactly is in this wagon of yours?" he inquired, a hint of skepticism in his voice.</p>
<p>Gundren leaned back, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Ah, a fair question," he responded, his tone tinged with secrecy. "Let's just say that it holds something of great value, both sentimentally and monetarily. It must reach its destination intact."</p>
<p>Mortimer, ever the pragmatic one, raised an eyebrow. "What's in it for us?" he asked, his voice laced with a touch of mischief.</p>
<p>Gundren's smile broadened as he reached into his pocket, producing a small leather pouch. He placed it on the table, and the clinking sound of gold coins filled the air. "Ten gold pieces each, my friends," he offered, his eyes gleaming with sincerity. "And, of course, the gratitude of a grateful dwarf."</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his eyes sparkling with noble determination, spoke up. "Your cause seems just, Gundren. We will gladly aid you in this task."</p>
<p>Orianna nodded, her tail flicking with excitement. "And a chance for adventure and a full purse? Count me in!" she chimed in, a mischievous grin spreading across her face.</p>
<p>Gundren's eyes twinkled with appreciation as he stood up, ready to depart. "Wonderful! Meet me at the town square tomorrow morning, and we'll set off on this grand journey together."</p>
<p>With heartfelt farewells, the adventurers bid Gundren farewell, their minds already filled with visions of the road ahead. They dispersed into the night, each preparing themselves mentally and physically for the task that awaited them.</p>
<p>The following morning, the sun rose with renewed vigor, casting its warm rays upon the town square. The adventurers gathered, their armor gleaming, their weapons at their sides. Excitement coursed through their veins as they set their sights on the road that would lead them to Phandalin.</p>
<p>Little did they know that this seemingly simple task would be the beginning of a grand adventure, a journey that would test their mettle, forge unbreakable bonds, and reveal secrets that would shape their destinies. With hearts ablaze, they embarked on their quest, ready to face the challenges that awaited them on the path to Phandalin.# Day 1</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/neverwinter.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="Neverwinter" src="../images/neverwinter.png" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Phandalin is a small, remote town located two days away from Neverwinter. </p>
<p>The next day, the group sets off on their journey to Phandalin, riding on a sturdy wagon pulled by a patient ox. The morning is bright and clear, and the road is relatively quiet.</p>
<p>As they travel, Mortimer breaks the silence. “So, what do you all know about Phandalin?” he asks.</p>
<p>Vaxidd turns to him. “It’s a small mining town, not far from here. Gundren has some business there, and we’re delivering supplies to Barthen’s Provisions.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see,” Mortimer nods. “And what of you, Sheod and Orianna? Any thoughts on our destination?”</p>
<p>Sheod, who had been keeping watch from the back of the wagon, speaks up. “I’ve never been there, but I’ve heard stories. They say there are ruins nearby, and rumours of lost treasure.”</p>
<p>Orianna chimes in. “And I’ve heard that the town has been struggling lately, with bandits and other unsavoury types causing trouble. Perhaps we can be of assistance while we’re there.”</p>
<p>Vaxidd nods. “That sounds like a noble goal. But let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves. Our first priority is to deliver these supplies safely to Barthen’s Provisions.”</p>
<p>With that, the group falls into a comfortable silence, each lost in their own thoughts as they continue down the road.</p>
<p>The first day of their journey is uneventful, with nothing but the sound of the wagon creaking and the ox’s steady breathing to break the monotony. They make camp as the sun begins to set, enjoying a simple meal of trail rations and roasted meat.</p>
<p>As they settle in for the night, Mortimer speaks up once more. “You know, I’ve always found the quiet of the wilderness to be quite soothing. It’s a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of city life.”</p>
<p>Sheod nods in agreement. “I know what you mean. There’s something peaceful about being out here, away from all the noise and distractions.”</p>
<p>Orianna smiles. “I have to say, I quite enjoy the quiet as well. It gives me time to think and compose new songs.”</p>
<p>Vaxidd chuckles. “Well, I’m glad we’re all finding some enjoyment in this journey. But let’s not forget, we have a job to do. We need to stay alert and keep our eyes peeled for any trouble that might come our way.”</p>
<p>With that, the group settles in for the night, taking turns keeping watch as they rest up for the next day of their journey.</p>
<h1 id="day-2">Day 2</h1>
<p>As the group continued their journey, the first day was uneventful. They made camp for the night and set off early in the morning, hoping to arrive in Phandalin by nightfall.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/02-ambush.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="ambush" src="../images/02-ambush.png" /></a></p>
<p>On the second day, as they came around a bend, they spotted two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of them, blocking the path. Each had several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods pressed close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side. The saddlebags had been looted. Nearby lay an empty leather map case.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard rustling in the bushes, and before they knew it, they were ambushed by a group of goblins! The goblins sprang from the woods, brandishing their weapons and screeching with rage.</p>
<p>Mortimer quickly scrambled for his spellbook, while Vaxidd charged forward with his warhammer. Sheod, the drow ranger, skillfully aimed his bow at one of the goblins and released an arrow, hitting it squarely in the chest. One of the goblins, fired an arrow at Mortimer, who took it in the arm, and rolled off the wagon, still clutching his spellbook.</p>
<p>Orianna, furious with the attack, began to sing a haunting melody, mocking viciously one of the goblins, who fell to the ground, writhing in pain. Mortimer used his telekinesis to throw the arrows from a goblin's quiver to the floor, confusing him. Vaxidd struck down another goblin with his warhammer, blood splattering his glimmering shield.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts, the goblins continued to attack. Sheod, calm and centered, fired arrows with precision, taking down another goblin. Mortimer swirled his fingers and flung his arm, casting a spell to put the last of the goblins to sleep. Vaxidd quickly tied up the sleeping goblin.</p>
<p>As the group took a moment to catch their breath, they discussed what to do next. They needed to know more about the goblins' intentions and who was behind the ambush.</p>
<p>"We need to interrogate this goblin and find out who sent them," Vaxidd said firmly. "Agreed," Mortimer nodded. "We need to know who's behind this."</p>
<p>Orianna approached the tied-up goblin and began to speak in a language the others didn't understand. The goblin looked up at her fearfully.</p>
<p>"What did you find out?" Sheod asked, impatiently.</p>
<p>"Their leader is a bugbear named Klarg," Orianna replied. "He answers to King Grol, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle. It's a long way due north"</p>
<p>"Klarg has told these goblins to ambush all travellers who pass through, and take all that they recover back to him to their hideout, a cave not far from here.</p>
<p>The group exchanged worried glances. "We need to find Gundren and make sure he's safe," Vaxidd said firmly. </p>
<p>Orianna turned to the goblin “You will show us this cave, and you will behave, and you will speak Common from now on”.</p>
<p>“Of Course, of course!” cowered the goblin “My name is Bobby the goblin, I will lead you to the trail to the cave where we are guarding the loot”</p>
<p>With Bob as their guide, the group sets off towards the cave, unsure of what they will find or what dangers they will face.</p>
<h2 id="into-the-cave">Into the cave</h2>
<p>As the group follows the goblin, they keep their eyes peeled for any sign of danger. Orianna grips her lute tightly, ready to use it as a weapon if necessary. Sheod leads the way, his bow at the ready, scanning the trees for any sign of movement.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/02-cave.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="cave" src="../images/02-cave.png" /></a></p>
<p>After about 15 minutes of tense walking, they arrive at the entrance of a cave. Sheod takes the lead, his keen ranger senses on full alert. As they approach the entrance, a putrid smell hits their nostrils. It's the stench of animals, and it's overwhelming.</p>
<p>As they enter the cave, they come upon a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end. But it's what's in between that catches their attention: three wolves, chained up and snarling ferociously.</p>
<p>The group approaches the wolves with caution. They can see the chains are secured to iron rods driven into the base of stalagmites. Orianna tries to calm the wolves with a soft melody on her lute, but it seems to have no effect. As they pass by, the wolves start pulling at their chains, trying to get free.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Sheod hears a loud snap, and the chains go slack. The wolves are loose! They lunge forward, snarling and baring their teeth. The group backs away, weapons at the ready, but the wolves are more interested in fleeing the cave than attacking them.</p>
<p>As the wolves disappear into the darkness, Mortimer steps forward, conjuring his small owl familiar to scout deeper into the cave. The owl flits off, clumsily navigating the cavern until it reaches a large chamber.</p>
<p>Through the owl's eyes, Mortimer sees a massive figure, twice the size of a normal human, wielding a menacing club. The figure spots the owl and with a quick swipe of his club, he kills it instantly. As the owl dissipates into the ether, Mortimer can still hear the figure mutter “Damn these things always flying in”, leaving Mortimer shaken.</p>
<p>Mortimer turns to the others, "There's someone big in there. And they're not friendly." They take a moment to regroup and plan their next move. They know they need to proceed with caution.</p>
<p>Sheod, Orianna, and Bobby carefully make their way through the side passage, their weapons drawn and ready. As they enter the large cave, they hear the sounds of goblins chattering and cooking over an open fire. The smell of smoke and unwashed goblins makes their eyes water.</p>
<p>They quickly spot Sildar, bound and unconscious on the southern ledge of the cavern. Sheod signals to the others to approach quietly. They cautiously make their way up the steep natural staircase to the upper ledge, trying not to make any noise.</p>
<p>As they reach the top, the goblin leader, Puglik, spots them and grabs Sildar, holding him tightly at the edge of the ledge. "Truce, or this human dies!" he threatens.</p>
<p>The adventurers exchange a worried glance, unsure of how to proceed. They can't risk Sildar's life, but they also can't let the goblins go unpunished. Puglik speaks up, trying to convince them to help him overthrow Klarg and become the new boss.</p>
<p>"Kill Klarg and bring me his head, and I'll release this human," Puglik promises.</p>
<p>Sheod steps forward, keeping his voice steady. "How do we know you'll keep your word?"</p>
<p>Puglik sneers. "You don't, but it's your best chance to get out of here alive."</p>
<p>Sheod nods, thinking quickly. "We'll need a plan. Can you tell us anything about Klarg's weaknesses?"</p>
<p>Puglik hesitates for a moment, then speaks. "Klarg is a powerful bugbear, but he's not too bright. He likes to show off his strength and intimidate his minions. If you can get him alone, he'll be an easy target."</p>
<p>Back in the main entrance, Vaxidd has no trouble seeing in the dark, a boon from his dwarven heritage, but Mortimer is blind. The atmosphere is tense, with the sound of dripping water echoing throughout the cavern. With a wave of his hand, Vaxidd’s helms begins to glow his helmet illuminating the path ahead. Mortimer, towering over Vaxidd, follows closely behind </p>
<p>Vaxidd grumbles, "This is ridiculous. I look like a walking lamp." </p>
<p>Mortimer chuckles, "Better a walking lamp than a blind one." </p>
<p>“At least make my shield glow instead, else I’ll kill the goblins with laughter” replies Vaxidd.</p>
<p>Mortimer flicks his finger in the air and the glow passes from his helmet to his shield.</p>
<p>As they approach a large chamber, the sound of rushing water grows louder. They can see a makeshift dam, constructed by the goblins to stop the water from flooding the main entrance. Vaxidd spots two goblins standing guard, looking nervous as they sense danger approaching.</p>
<p>Mortimer quickly conjures an illusion in the shape of a large, immobile black bear behind the goblins. He cups his hands and roars, the roar appearing to come form the bear itself, sending one of the goblins fleeing in fear. The other goblin, however, runs straight into Vaxidd, who wastes no time and brings down his warhammer upon the creature's skull with a sickening crunch, sending bone and brain matter splattering in all directions.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the massive bugbear, Klarg, jumps out from an opening, swinging his club at the illusion of the bear, his pet dire wolf by his side. For a moment, Klarg freezes, disbelieving his eyes, trying to hit the illusion again, but it's like trying to grasp smoke. Klarg's confusion and frustration grow with every missed swing.</p>
<p>Sheod and Orianna, who had been exploring the cave ahead of Vaxidd and Mortimer, arrive to join the fray. Orianna begins by hurling insults at Klarg, calling him names that question his strength and masculinity, and mocking his appearance and intelligence. She then weaves subtle enchantments into her words, amplifying their effect and causing Klarg to become confused and disoriented. The insults, combined with the enchantments, strike at Klarg's confidence and resolve, making him feel vulnerable and unsure of himself. As a result, his attacks become slower and heavy with doubt.</p>
<p>Sheod takes aim with his bow and shoots an arrow between Klarg's eyes. The arrow tip skewers his skull, as blood spatters across the floor and Klarg falls dead to the ground, his face still in confusion with all the events leading to his demise.</p>
<p>As the dire wolf charges towards Vaxidd, its eyes glowing with fury, Vaxidd can feel his heart racing in his chest. He braces himself and readies his warhammer, feeling the weight of it in his hands. "Looks like this pup wants a piece of me," he says, a sly grin spreading across his face.</p>
<p>The wolf lunges forward, teeth bared, and Vaxidd swings his hammer with all his might. The impact is bone-crushing, and the wolf lets out a final, blood-curdling yelp before collapsing to the ground in a lifeless heap. Vaxidd takes a moment to catch his breath, his shield still glowing faintly.</p>
<p>After the battle, Sheod wipes the blood off his blade and swiftly decapitates Klarg, holding up the grisly trophy as proof of their success. Orianna nods approvingly, but her eyes betray a hint of sadness for the life that was taken.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mortimer and Vaxidd scavenge the goblins' bodies and Klarg's corpse for loot. Mortimer's eyes light up at the sight of the potions and spell scrolls, while Vaxidd grumbles about the lack of real treasure. They also find a crate marked with the image of a blue lion — the symbol of the Lionshield, a merchant company with a warehouse and trading post in Phandalin. Vaxidd takes it without effort.</p>
<p>As Sheod and Orianna present Klarg's head to Puglik, the situation takes a turn for the worse. Puglik snatches Sildar and holds a knife to his throat, demanding more gold. Sheod's hands grip his bow, ready to shoot, but Orianna places a calming hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Please, Puglik," she pleads. "We fulfilled our end of the bargain. Let Sildar go."</p>
<p>Puglik's eyes narrow. "Not until I get what's mine."</p>
<p>Mortimer steps forward, holding out a pouch of gold. "Here, take it all. Just let Sildar go unharmed."</p>
<p>Sheod rolls his eyes at Mortimer's statement, but his annoyance quickly fades as he watches the wizard's hand dip into his pouch. Mortimer's fingers emerge, clutching a handful of sparkling sand, which he flicks towards Puglik's face.</p>
<p>The goblin leader sputters and gasps as the sand hits him, before collapsing in a heap on the ground. Sheod stares in disbelief at the sleeping goblin, realizing that the sand was no ordinary dust.</p>
<p>"By Moradin's beard," Vaxidd exclaims, "that was a sleep spell! Where did you learn that, Mortimer?"</p>
<p>Mortimer shrugs, "Just a little trick I picked up in my travels."</p>
<p>The other goblins freeze, unsure of what to do now that their leader has fallen.</p>
<p>Vaxidd steps forward, a fierce glint in his eyes. "We're taking Sildar and leaving. If any of you try to stop us, you'll end up like your boss."</p>
<p>The goblins shrink back in fear as Sheod and Vaxidd carry Sildar's unconscious form out of the cave. As they emerge into the bright sunlight, the weight of their victory settles over them. Orianna can't help but feel a twinge of guilt for the violence they've wrought. Sheod, on the other hand, feels a surge of pride for protecting their friend and fulfilling their mission. Mortimer is already pouring over the spell scrolls, eager to learn new magic. And Vaxidd is still muttering about the lack of treasure.</p>
<h2 id="trip-to-phandalin">Trip to Phandalin</h2>
<p>As the group emerged from the cave, they found themselves in a small clearing. Vaxidd, with a look of concentration on his face, knelt down beside Sildar and laid his hands on the wounded man, invoking his Paladin's powers to heal Sildar's wounds.</p>
<p>As Sildar regained consciousness, he looked up at the party with gratitude in his eyes. "Thank you," he said, his voice weak but sincere. "I don't know how I can repay you for saving my life."</p>
<p>Sheod stepped forward, his bow at his side. "Don't worry about it," he said, a smirk playing across his face. "We're always happy to help someone in need."</p>
<p>Sildar nodded gratefully, then his expression turned serious. "I'm anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible," he said. "I have urgent business there."</p>
<p>Vaxidd nodded. "Of course," he said. "We'll help you get there safely."</p>
<p>As they walked towards their ox cart, Sildar shared what he knew about Gundren's disappearance. "Gundren had a map," he said. "But the goblins took it when they captured him. Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, was given specific orders to ambush and capture Gundren. The Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought in."</p>
<p>"I hate spiders," Mortimer mutters, shuddering.</p>
<p>Sheod's eyes widened at the mention of the Black Spider. "Do you know who or what the Black Spider is?" he asked.</p>
<p>Sildar shook his head. "I'm afraid I don't," he said. "But I heard from the goblins that he's the one who's behind all of this."</p>
<p>The group exchanged worried glances, but Vaxidd spoke up, his voice firm. "We'll figure this out," he said. "And we'll make sure that Gundren is safe."</p>
<p>With that, the group climbed onto the ox cart and set off towards Phandalin, determined to uncover the truth about the Black Spider and Gundren's disappearance.</p>
<h2 id="passing-the-time">Passing the time</h2>
<p>Mortimer turned to Vaxidd with a sheepish look on his face. "I owe you an apology, my dear friend. I used you as a decoy in that cave, and I'm sorry for that," he said.</p>
<p>Vaxidd let out a loud belly laugh. "Oh, don't worry, my dear wizard. It was quite the thrilling experience. I always enjoy being the bait for goblins," he said with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>Mortimer raised an eyebrow. "Well, that's not quite what I meant. You see, I'm useless in the dark without my familiar. I was going to make my hat glow, but I didn't want to give away our position."</p>
<p>Vaxidd burst out laughing. "Ah, I see! Well, I suppose I should be flattered to be your designated bait. But don't worry, my friend. You've only helped me fulfill one of my missions: to protect those in need."</p>
<p>Mortimer chuckled. "I guess that means I owe you one. Or maybe two, considering how well you handled those goblins."</p>
<p>Mortimer then turned to Orianna and said, "I know you can put yourself in anyone's good graces, but goblins don't have enough intelligence to understand the concept of friendship. Most only understand food and violence, so I'm not surprised that Bob was left behind in the cave."</p>
<p>Orianna smiled slyly, "Mortimer, I know goblins are not intelligent, but I thought you knew how much I like to make new friends even if they have fewer brains."</p>
<p>Sheod grumbled, "By the gods, why couldn't they make me deaf during the day instead of blind? All this kindness and fresh air is making my head spin. I'll walk with the ox as he doesn't speak much. The only reliefe is that at teh end fo this I'll earn me some coin...."</p>
<p>Mortimer muttered under his breath, "Geez, what a grouch." Then he turned to Sheod and said, "Hey Sheod, I have a challenge for you."</p>
<p>Sheod raised an eyebrow, "And what would that be?"</p>
<p>Mortimer snapped his fingers and three gold coins floated out of his pouch, hovering in the air at different distances. "You have three shots. Every coin you hit with your bow is yours. Every time you miss, you pay me one. How about that?"</p>
<p>Sheod smirked, "Hmph, even after turning that Bugbear into a unicorn, you still doubt my aim? I'll make you a more interesting proposal. When we stop, toss the coin as high as you can. If I hit it, you give me free access to the library's entire collection, and you also reserve for me all the information you can get that has to do with the Umbreterna... I don't want your gold, I'm looking for something more...rare."</p>
<p>Mortimer grinned, "I don't doubt your aim, but it's to see if it was luck or not. Come on, it helps pass the time. And don't worry, I'm happy to give you whatever I can tell you about Umbreterna. By the way, in the Common tongue it is called The Underdark."</p>
<p>Sheod took aim and shot an arrow, hitting the nearest coin with a loud ding.</p>
<p>Mortimer clapped, "Bravo! One coin you've already won. Do you still want to try your luck on the others?" The coins began to levitate and move away.</p>
<p>"Keep them, Mage. As proof of being one of the few I enjoy the company of. Except for the moments of exaggerated tenderness. I'm going to check the horizon to see how far away we still are." Sheod smirked, reluctantly allowing himself to relax and smile in acceptance of the group.</p>
<h2 id="arriving-at-phandalin">Arriving at Phandalin</h2>
<p>As the sun sets, casting its warm golden glow over the horizon, our intrepid adventurers finally arrive at the fabled city of Phandalin.</p>
<p>Phandalin, a place steeped in both history and tragedy, stands proudly on the remnants of a once-thriving settlement. Long ago, the town flourished in harmony with the dwarves and gnomes of the legendary Phandelver's Pact. Alas, the ravages of a savage orc horde reduced Phandalin to ruins, leaving it abandoned for countless years.</p>
<p>However, hope and determination have breathed new life into this forgotten place. Over the past few years, brave settlers from the bustling cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have dared to reclaim the shattered remains of Phandalin. What was once desolate now teems with life as farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and fortune seekers have flocked to these lands, enticed by rumors of untold riches hidden within the foothills of the formidable Sword Mountains. Yet, amidst this renaissance, a dark cloud looms. A notorious gang known as the Redbrands has seized control of Phandalin, inflicting fear and oppression upon its inhabitants. The shadowy figure leading the gang, known as Glasstaff, remains a mystery, haunting the dreams of the townsfolk.</p>
<p>As the weary travelers continue their journey, the rutted track emerges from the dense woodland, unveiling the first glimpse of Phandalin. The town stands defiantly, its simple log structures mingling with ancient fieldstone foundations. Ruins, once proud stone walls, now succumb to the relentless embrace of ivy and thorny briars, poignant reminders of a grandeur long past. The juxtaposition of old and new whispers tales of a bygone era when Phandalin thrived as a bustling hub of activity. The main road, which was once a mere cart track, now stretches before them, morphing into a muddy artery that winds its way towards a dilapidated manor house perched upon a hill on the eastern fringes of town.</p>
<p>Approaching closer, the sight unfolds like a vivid tapestry. Laughter and playful shouts fill the air as children revel in the freedom of the town green. Townsfolk diligently attend to their daily chores, scurrying about the shops and market stalls, their faces a tapestry of determination and resilience. Inquisitive gazes turn towards the approaching adventurers, momentarily piqued by the unfamiliar arrivals, before returning to the pressing demands of their own lives.</p>
<p>Sildar, still recovering from his ordeal, could feel his muscles relaxing as the goblins became a distant memory. "My friends," he said with a relieved smile, "let us seek rest. I'm told the Twilight Refuge is a charming place to stay".</p>
<p>Orianna hesitated as Sildar suggested they secure lodgings at the Twilight Refuge. Her heart raced with mixed emotions at the mere thought of seeing her parents again after two decades of estrangement. She knew that the inn was owned and operated by her parents, and the thought of facing them again made her feel both anxious and nostalgic.</p>
<p>Mortimer, the old wizard, noticed Orianna's unease and placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Are you alright, my dear?" he asked with genuine concern. Orianna took a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves. "I'm fine," she replied, but her trembling voice betrayed her anxiety. "It's just that...the inn is run by my parents. I haven't seen them in a very long time."</p>
<p>The rest of the group looked at Orianna with understanding, and Vaxidd nodded sympathetically. "I see," he said. "It must be difficult for you. But perhaps it's time to face your past and make amends with your family."</p>
<p>"Agreed." said Mortimer "But maybe let's drop off our cargo at the Lionshield place first". Orianna sighed with relief, but was still tense in anxiety of seeing her parents again. The group made their way to the Lionshield building, a modest trading post owned by a wealthy merchant company from Yartar. As they entered, they were greeted by Linene, the sharp-tongued master of the trading post. Her piercing eyes scanned each of the adventurers, lingering on Orianna.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the Phandalin post," Linene said, her voice businesslike. "I'm Linene, the master of this trading post. What brings you here?"</p>
<p>"We have recovered some stolen goods from the goblins," Mortimer spoke up. "And we were hoping to return them to their rightful owner."</p>
<p>Linene inspected the goods carefully, relieved to see they were from the Lionshield caravan. "We though these were lost forever! Where did you find them?".</p>
<p>"A bugbear and a group of goblins were jumping every caravan that would pass the road from here to Neverwinter" recounted Mortimer, while lighting his pipe "We had to part them from this cargo as well as their heads...". "These will help a lot of people here in Phandalin" Linene said ", as well as keep my business afloat. Let me repay you for your troubles". She reached into a nearby drawer and drew a hefty bag, which she gave each traveller 50 gold pieces from.</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Sheod said. "But we were just doing what any honorable person would do."</p>
<p>Linene nodded, studying each adventurer. "I appreciate your honesty and bravery," she said. "But be warned, this town has its share of troublemakers. I wouldn't trust just anyone here."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Sheod asked.</p>
<p>"The Redbrands," Linene replied, her voice dropping to a whisper. "They're a group of ruffians who have been causing a lot of trouble around here. I won't do business with them, and I suggest you avoid them as well. They're nothing but trouble."</p>
<p>As the group left the trading post, Orianna's nerves began to escalate. "I don't know if I can do this," she admitted to the group. "It's been so long, and I don't know what to say to them." Mortimer patted her back. "You'll find the words," he reassured her. "Just be yourself."</p>
<p>The Twilight Refuge was a quaint, two-story building with a thatched roof and a sign bearing its name swinging in the breeze. As they approached, Orianna could see her father through the window, bustling about inside. Her heart leaped into her throat, and she hesitated.</p>
<p>"Go on," Vaxidd urged. "We'll be right here with you."</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Orianna pushed open the door and stepped inside. The sound of laughter and conversation filled her ears as she scanned the room for her parents. Her eyes landed on a pair of figures sitting by the fireplace, and she froze.</p>
<p>"Dad?" she whispered, her voice barely audible.</p>
<p>Her father turned, and his eyes widened in shock. "Orianna?" his father gasped.</p>
<p>After a moment of stunned silence, Orianna's father rushed to embrace her. "We thought we'd lost you forever," her father said, his voice choked with emotion. He was a large individual, tall in size and with a big round belly. He had an apron, dirty from his chores, thick arms from manual labour and his knuckles were bruised.</p>
<p>"I've missed you so much. Where is mom?" said Orianna, now relieved from receiving a large embrace from her father. He replied his gaze sobering "Ah, we sent her to Leilon, along with two of your brothers. It wasn't as safe as we wanted here, what with the Redbrands harassing us all the time. We decided best that she go there for a while and come back once things are more calm." he then noticed the group that came in behind Oriana, the armoured dwarf, the somber drow, and the aged wizard.</p>
<p>"These are my friends," Orianna announced proudly, gesturing towards Sheod, Vaxidd and Mortimer. "We've been together since Neverwinter." Her father shifted his attention towards the group, wiping his hands on his apron. "I don't have enough rooms for each of you," he admitted. "But the ones I have are quite ample. If you don't mind sharing, you're welcome to stay and rest."</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Vaxidd tossed a gold coin onto the counter and exclaimed, "A flagon of your finest ale, innkeep!" Meanwhile, Mortimer made his way to a nearby table, the chair sliding out on its own to allow him to sit. With a snap of his fingers, the hearth blazed to life, illuminating the tavern with a warm glow. Sliding a coin across the counter, Sheod grabbed a turkey drumstick and a bottle before making his way upstairs. Exhausted from the journey, all he wanted was to rest. As he settled into the bedroom and the day began to wind down, Sheod caught a glimpse of a dark figure perched on one of the rooftops. The figure gazed back at him before vanishing, leaving Sheod uncertain if it had even been there at all.</p>
<p>Sheod dashed down the stairs and back to Orianna's father, who had been preparing some food. "Sir, what can you tell us about the Redbrands?" Sheod asked.</p>
<p>Orianna's father looked up and his expression became solemn. "The Redbrands have been causing a lot of trouble in town lately. They steal from the people and bully them. Nobody knows who they are or what they want, but they've been causing a lot of fear and tension."</p>
<p>Sheod's friends, Vaxidd and Mortimer, joined him at the counter. "What can we do to stop them?" Vaxidd asked.</p>
<p>"Well, the Redbrands have been seen hanging out at the Sleeping Giant Inn up the road," Orianna's father said. "If you want to investigate further, that's a good place to start. But be careful, they're not to be underestimated."</p>
<p>Mortimer cracked his knuckles. "Sounds like it's time to teach those Redbrands a lesson," he said, a wicked grin on his face.</p>
<p>Sheod raised an eyebrow at Mortimer's enthusiasm but nodded in agreement. "We'll need a plan," he said. "What else can you tell us about them?"</p>
<p>Orianna's father thought for a moment. "There's a mansion at the edge of town where they're known to gather. It's heavily guarded, though. If you're going to take them on, you'll need to be well-prepared."</p>
<p>Sheod and his friends exchanged determined looks. "We won't let them terrorize this town any longer," Sheod said. "Thank you for your help, sir. I'll be back." and he dashed out the door.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sheod stumbled up the dimly lit street, making sure to keep his hood low over his face. As he rounded the corner towards the Sleeping Giant Inn, he spotted two Redbrands loitering outside. He slowed his pace, trying to look as drunk as possible, and approached them with a lopsided grin.</p>
<p>"Hey, fellas," Sheod slurred. "You guys look like you're havin' a good time. Mind if I join in?"</p>
<p>The Redbrands exchanged a look of annoyance before turning back to Sheod. "Beat it, drunk," one of them growled.</p>
<p>Sheod feigned offense, swaying back and forth. "C'mon, guys. I just wanna have a drink and chat with some friendly faces."</p>
<p>The other Redbrand snorted. "We're not here to make friends, idiot. Now go away before we make you."</p>
<p>Sheod's fingers tightened around the bottle in his hand, his mind racing. He knew he needed to distract them somehow. Without warning, he hurled the bottle at the ruffians, but it sailed wide and smashed against the wall.</p>
<p>The Redbrands drew their swords, their faces twisted in anger. "That was a mistake, pal," one of them spat.</p>
<p>Sheod stumbled backwards, his hands up in surrender. "Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean it. I'll just go away now."</p>
<p>The Redbrands watched him retreat up the road, their eyes narrowed. Sheod's heart pounded in his chest, relieved to be out of their sight.</p>
<p>As the night wore on, the patrons of the Twilight Refuge Inn turned in one by one, the sounds of snoring and the crackling fire filling the air. Sheod lay in his bed, his mind racing with thoughts of the Redbrands and their nefarious activities. He knew he needed to find out more. Orianna, her heart relieved from seeing her father again. Vaxidd with a full belly of ale, bread, cheese and meat. And Mortimer, fast asleep, snoring loudly and occasionally letting out a muffled snort.# Day 3</p>
<h2 id="talking-around-town">Talking around town</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/03-phandalin.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="phandalin" src="../images/03-phandalin.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>As the party arrived in Phandalin, they quickly learned that asking around about Cragmaw Castle was a dead end. "Cragmaw Castle? I'm sorry, I haven't heard of it," Qelline Alderleaf, a kindly halfling farmer, told them apologetically. "But I do know that the Redbrands are causing trouble around town. I've heard they hang out at the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town."</p>
<p>At the mention of the Redbrands, Sildar Hallwinter spoke up. "Those ruffians have been a thorn in the side of Phandalin for far too long. It's time someone took a stand against their leader, Glasstaff."</p>
<p>The group continued their inquiries, talking to the various townsfolk in the hopes of finding any useful information. They learned that the goblins, who had once been a problem in Phandalin, had seemingly disappeared since the Redbrands arrived. The lack of a functioning government was also evident, with the townsfolk electing a new mayor each year. The current mayor, a pompous old fool, seemed completely intimidated by the Redbrands. "Oh, they're just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really," he blustered.</p>
<p>As the characters wander through Phandalin, they may come across a small shrine made of worn stones from nearby ruins. The peacefulness of the shrine is interrupted by the sight of a worried-looking acolyte tending to it. Upon closer inspection, they see that she's Sister Garaele.</p>
<p>Approaching her, they can hear her murmur to herself, "If only I could get rid of those Redbrands...but it's hopeless." As she notices the characters, she looks up and greets them, "Greetings, travelers. I'm Sister Garaele, the caretaker of this humble shrine."</p>
<p>After some small talk, Sister Garaele confides in the adventurers. "I have a request, if you're willing to help. I've been trying to convince a banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook belonging to the legendary mage Bowgendle. But I can't seem to persuade her to give me a straight answer. Perhaps if someone were to bring her a gift, something shiny, she might be more willing to talk."</p>
<p>She pauses for a moment before continuing, "I would be eternally grateful if you could help me with this task. The spellbook in question is of great importance, and I believe it could help us rid Phandalin of the Redbrands."</p>
<p>The mere mention of spellbooks set Mortimer's mind racing with curiosity. His eyes lit up with a glint of fascination, and he leaned in, eager to learn more.</p>
<p>"Seems like there's a lot to be done in Phandalin" said Vaxidd. "But I fear we will accomplish nothing until we rid the town of the Redbrands." stated Sheod.</p>
<p>Feeling frustrated, the party decided to head to the Sleeping Giant to confront the Redbrands directly. As they arrived the tap house, they could hear the rowdy laughter and shouting of the ruffians.</p>
<h2 id="brawling-with-the-redbrands">Brawling with the Redbrands</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/03-redbrands-ruffians.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="ruffians" src="../images/03-redbrands-ruffians.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>The adventurers walked stealthily walked around the back of the Inn, and looked into the Inn through the dirty windows.</p>
<p>The Redbrands lurked inside the grimy taproom, while the adventurers peered through the dusty windows. The atmosphere was thick with tension as they surveyed the dingy establishment. Tables and chairs were scattered haphazardly, and the walls were adorned with crude paintings and unidentifiable stains. It was clear that this was not a place for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>As the party was still devising a plan to enter,The door burst open, and the ruffians stormed out with menacing scowls. "What the hell do you think you're doing, peeping toms?" growled one of the Redbrands, cracking his knuckles. "This is our territory, and you're not welcome here!" Another ruffian sneered, "You're gonna regret crossing us, pretty boy." The adventurers knew they were in for a fight.</p>
<p>The Redbrands were dressed in scarlet cloaks, their eyes fixed on the adventurers with a menacing gaze.</p>
<p>The adventurers stood their ground, ready for a fight. Vaxidd charged forward, his warhammer glinting in the light. With a swift swing, as if Moradin himself was hammering iron on his anvil, he hammered one of the Redbrands caving his head into his torso.</p>
<p>Sheod, swiftly ran at the Inn's wall, kicking it at the last minute and jumping into the air, gaining height enough to seet eh face of the ruffian at the back. He pulled his arrow back and the arrow flew, skewering him between the eyes. The ruffian was dead before he dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>Orianna, the bard, played her lute "I didn't know a goblin's breath could be that foul! You must have eaten something truly disgusting!". HEr insults, laced with arcane power struck the very essence of the ruffian, and he dropped, clutching his chest, dead. With a flick of his wrist, Mortimer held out his well-worn spellbook and chanted the incantation for a sleep spell. As he did, he could feel the crackle of arcane energy building within him, and he directed it towards the ruffian with a fierce determination. The ruffian, caught off guard by Mortimer's sudden attack, felt a wave of drowsiness wash over him as he struggled to keep his eyes open. Despite his efforts, however, the sleep spell overcame him, and he slumped to the ground in a deep slumber. Mortimer let out a small sigh of relief as he closed his spellbook, satisfied that the ruffian would be no threat to him or anyone else for a while.</p>
<h2 id="an-unlikely-ally">An unlikely ally</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/03-unlikely-ally.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="ally" src="../images/03-unlikely-ally.png" /></a></p>
<p>Orianna volunteered to go fetch the mayor, while the others kept watch over the tied-up ruffian.</p>
<p>As the adventurers tied up the last ruffian, they noticed a strange figure lurking in the shadows. She was a woman, with dark hair and piercing eyes, who seemed to be watching them intently. She stepped forward and introduced herself as Sariel, and she was very interested in the box that Gundren had asked them to keep safe.</p>
<p>"I'll give you 50gp for it," she said, her eyes glinting with avarice.</p>
<p>Mortimer stepped forward, his hand on his spellbook. "Sorry, miss, but that box isn't ours to give away. It belongs to our friend Gundren."</p>
<p>Sariel smirked. "Ah, Gundren. Yes, I know of him. In fact, I may be able to help you find him."</p>
<p>The adventurers exchanged wary glances. "What do you mean?" asked Vaxidd.</p>
<p>"I have information about his whereabouts," said Sariel. "But it will cost you. Meet me outside of town at midnight, and I'll bring Gundren with me. We can make the exchange then."</p>
<p>The adventurers were skeptical. "Why should we trust you?" asked Sheod.</p>
<p>Sariel shrugged. "You don't have to. But I think you'll find that I'm the only one who can help you find your friend."</p>
<p>As they waited for Orianna's return, the Redbrands' bodies lay scattered around them, a testament to their skill and bravery. But the adventurers knew that their journey was far from over, and that danger lay ahead.</p>
<h2 id="allying-with-the-mayor">Allying with the Mayor</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/03-mayor-harbin.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="mayor harbin" src="../images/03-mayor-harbin.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>Orianna ran off to fetch the Mayor while the adventurers secured the last ruffian. The Mayor's office was in the town hall, a modest building made of wood and stone. Orianna found the Mayor pacing back and forth inside his cluttered office.</p>
<p>"Mayor, we need your help, come quick!" Orianna said as she burst into the room.</p>
<p>The Mayor jumped at the sudden intrusion. "Good gods! Don't scare me like that!"</p>
<p>"We captured one of the of the Redbrands," Orianna continued, "and we need to keep him in jail. Can you help us with that?"</p>
<p>The Mayor's eyes widened in fear. "The Redbrands!? Oh, I don't know if I can do that. They'll retaliate for sure." fetching his jacket "Take me to where you have him".</p>
<p>Orianna and the Mayor rushed back to the Sleeping Giant inn, one of the ruffians tied and wrigglign to leave, Sheod keeping him in place with his boot.</p>
<p>Vaxidd stepped forward with his imposing figure towards the Mayor. "You're the Mayor of this town, aren't you? We need your authority to keep this town safe."</p>
<p>The Mayor cowered at Vaxidd's words. "Y-yes, yes, of course. I'll send some guards to lock up the prisoner."</p>
<p>Sheod chimed in, "We also heard that you were offering a reward for dealing with the Redbrands. Is that true?"</p>
<p>The Mayor's eyes darted around nervously. "W-well, yes. I can offer you 100 gold pieces if you rid us of those thugs."</p>
<p>Mortimer smirked. "That sounds like a fair deal. We'll take care of them, but you better make sure that prisoner stays locked up tight."</p>
<p>The Mayor nodded fervently. "I will, I will. Just please be careful. The Redbrands are a dangerous lot."</p>
<h2 id="infiltrating-the-redbrand-hideout">Infiltrating the Redbrand hideout</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/03-redbrands.webp" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="redbrands" src="../images/03-redbrands.webp" /></a></p>
<p>Towering over the eastern edge of Phandalin, Tresendar Manor looms like a giant sentinel, a relic of a time long past. The once-grand estate has fallen into disrepair, its walls cracked and overgrown with vines, its windows shattered and boarded up. However, the true danger lies beneath the surface.</p>
<p>As the adventurers approach Tresendar Manor, they can feel the weight of its history bearing down upon them. The air is thick with the stench of decay and neglect. From the outside, the manor appears quiet and deserted, but the sound of muffled voices and the clinking of armor can be heard from below.</p>
<p>"There's no telling how many of them are down there," says Vaxidd, his hand tightly gripping the hilt of his hammer. "But we can't let them continue to terrorize Phandalin."</p>
<p>Mortimer pulled out a tiny, black velvet pouch from the folds of his robes, opening it carefully to reveal a spider with shimmering, dark celestial markings. He whispered an incantation, and the spider sprang to life, skittering onto his hand. </p>
<p>Sheod recoiled at the sight of the spider, his hand reflexively gripping the hilt of his sword. "I don't like spiders, Mortimer. Not one bit," he said, eyeing the arachnid with unease.</p>
<p>"I know, but trust me, she'll be of great help to us," Mortimer reassured her, and with a flick of his wrist, he sent the spider scurrying towards the Tresendar manor.</p>
<p>Mortimer's eyes glowed with a faint, otherworldly light as he focused his mind, telepathically communicating with the spider. The spider crept under the manor, navigating its way through the dark and musty tunnels beneath. </p>
<p>Suddenly, Mortimer's eyes went foggy, and he shuddered slightly as he became more attuned to the spider's senses. The spider had discovered a hidden room, where two Redbrand ruffians were slumped on cots, nursing their drinks and chatting about the recent arrival of the adventurers in town.</p>
<p>"You hear about those adventurers that came into town?" asked the first one. The second one nodded. "Yeah, I heard they were causing trouble for us."</p>
<p>"Well, we can't let them get in our way. We need to protect Glasstaff's plans."."Agreed," said the second one. "I heard they were at the Sleeping Giant earlier. Maybe we should pay them a little visit and teach them a lesson." The first one hesitated. "Let's not be hasty. We need to wait for the boss's orders before we do anything. We don't want to act without his permission.". "Fine," grumbled the second one. "But we need to be ready. I'm tired of these adventurers thinking they can just come here and cause trouble.". The first one nodded, a dark look in his eyes. "Me too, brother. Me too."</p>
<p>"We've got company," Mortimer said, his voice distant and unfocused as he maintained his telepathic link with the spider. "Two Redbrands in a hidden room beneath the manor. We need to move fast."</p>
<p>Sheod motioned for the others to stay quiet and crouch low to the ground. They moved forward cautiously, their eyes scanning the dimly lit basement for any sign of danger. The air was musty and thick with the scent of damp stone and mildew. The floor was slick with moisture, making it difficult to move silently. Vaxidd's heavy armor clanged loudly with each step, making Sheod wince. Suddenly, there was a loud commotion, and the sound of rushing footsteps. The Redbrands had been alerted to their presence.</p>
<p>As they descended further, the group reached a landing, and saw two Redbrands charging towards them with weapons drawn. Mortimer quickly drew his spellbook and began casting a spell, but it was too late. Vaxidd's heavy armor had already given them away.</p>
<p>The Redbrands lunged forward, their swords flashing in the dim light. Vaxidd swung his weapon, but one of the Redbrands deftly dodged the attack and struck him with the pommel of his sword. Vaxidd stumbled back, his armor clanging loudly as he fell. Orianna quickly regained her composure and began casting a fear spell. One of the Redbrands shrieked and ran away, cowering in fear. The other continued to fight, but with Sheod's help, they managed to take him down.</p>
<p>As the dust settled, Mortimer sent out his familiar, a dark celestial spider, to scout ahead. The spider scurried along the walls and ceilings, making its way through the dark and musty tunnels. Finally, it reached a large natural cavern, and Mortimer saw the fleeing Redbrand.</p>
<p>He also saw something else, a creature lurking in the darkness. Mortimer's heart raced as he recognized it from his studies - a Nothic, an insane subterranean monster that hungered for flesh. Mortimer knew they were in for a fight if they wanted to get past the Nothic and uncover the secrets of the Redbrand stronghold. Mortimer quickly relayed the information to the group, and they hesitated. They knew they couldn't face the Nothic head-on, not without more preparation. But they also knew they had to press on. They were so close to discovering the secrets of the Redbrands' stronghold.</p>
<p>"Mortimer," Sheod said, his voice low and urgent. "We can't let the Nothic stop us. We have to find a way past it."</p>
<p>Sheod charged down the hallway, his heart pounding in his chest as he searched for a way around the nothic. But as he ran, his foot caught on a loose floorboard, and suddenly he was falling through the ground. He let out a cry of surprise and pain as he plummeted down into the darkness, landing hard on the bottom of a deep pit trap. His head spun, and he felt like he had the wind knocked out of him.</p>
<p>The others rushed to his aid, Vaxidd lowered a length of rope down into the pit "Looks like you could use a hand, friend!" he called out.
Sheod grabbed the rope and allowed himself to be hoisted up. Up top, his face twisted in pain as he gingerly tested his injured leg. Sheod winced with each movement, but he gritted his teeth and soldiered on.</p>
<p>Vaxidd looked at the narrow boards on the sides of the pit and shook his head. "There's no way we can cross this. They're too narrow, and we can't jump that far." Mortimer, however, remained calm. He reached out his open hand and said, "There's no need to jump." With a flick of his wrist, a spectral, floating hand appeared and grabbed the end of the rope Vaxidd was holding. The hand carried the rope across the pit and tied it across one of the iron torch holders on the other side.</p>
<p>Sheod let out a sigh of relief. "That was close," he said as the group tied the other end of the rope and used it as support to cross the pit. As they crossed, Mortimer couldn't help but notice the eerie silence of the crypt. The only sound was the faint rustling of their clothes and the creaking of the rope. Finally, they made it to the other side, and Mortimer saw a pair of doors in the southeast corner.</p>
<p>He motioned for the group to approach and whispered, "Be on your guard. We don't know what's behind those doors." With caution, they pushed the doors open, revealing a dusty crypt. "Three large stone sarcophagi," Mortimer murmured as he scanned the room. "And propped up against each one is a human skeleton clad in bits of rusty mail." Sheod, still wearing a red cloak from the Redbrands approached one of the skeletons and examined it closely. "These are old. They've been here for a while."</p>
<p>Sheod joined him and looked around. "What is this place?" he asked. As Mortimer made his way across the dusty crypt, his foot hit a loose stone and he nearly lost his balance. He managed to regain his footing, but the sound of his misstep echoed through the chamber. Suddenly, the three stone sarcophagi burst open, and the skeletons propped against them stirred to life. The group was caught off guard, and before they could react, the skeletons charged at them with rusted swords.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/03-skeleton.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="skeleton" src="../images/03-skeleton.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>Sheod drew his sword and tried to defend himself, but the skeletons were relentless. Mortimer, who had been studying the carvings on the walls, spun around to see the chaos. One of the skeletons lunged at him, cutting a gash on his shoulder, and Mortimer instinctively raised his hand, firing three magic bolts that struck the skeleton in the chest, crumbling it to the ground.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vaxidd stepped in front of Mortimer, using his shield to deflect the blows of the other two skeletons. Orianna joined the fray, her rapier whirling around as she delivered a powerful blow that decapitated one of the skeletons. Vaxidd swung his Hammer, shattering the last skeleton into pieces.</p>
<p>The group stood there, panting and sweating from the battle. Mortimer rushed over to Vaxidd, checking to make sure he was okay. "You saved my life," Mortimer said, his voice shaking with emotion. Vaxidd smiled wearily. "That's what friends are for," he said.</p>
<p>Orianna looked around the room, her eyes taking in the carvings and the copper-plated doors. "I have a feeling this is just the beginning," she said. "We need to be ready for anything." Vaxidd moved towards the double doors in the southeast corner. "These doors are sheathed in tarnished copper plate. It looks like they lead somewhere important."</p>
<p>Mortimer nodded. "Then that's where we need to go."</p>
<p>The group cautiously pushed open the tarnished copper-plated double doors, revealing a room occupied by two Redbrand ruffians. The air grew tense as the ruffians locked eyes with Sheod, his red cloak mistaken for their own. Confusion flickered across their faces, and the adventurers seized the opportunity to explain their presence.</p>
<p>Sheod stepped forward, his voice steady but firm. "We are not your allies," he clarified, his words laced with a hint of warning. "We are under attack, just like you. We mean you no harm."</p>
<p>The ruffians, recognizing the sincerity in Sheod's voice, quickly processed the information. They exchanged a brief glance, realizing the gravity of the situation. Without hesitation, they retreated into one of the nearby cells, hastily locking themselves inside. The metallic sound of the cell door clanging shut echoed through the chamber.</p>
<p>Relief washed over the adventurers as they spotted a small cell adjacent to the ruffians' enclosure. Inside, a woman and her young child huddled together, their eyes filled with a mixture of fear and hope. Orianna, her heart filled with empathy, approached them with gentle reassurance.</p>
<p>"It's all right now," she said, her voice soft and comforting. "We're here to help. You're safe."</p>
<p>With trembling hands, Orianna unlocked the cell door, allowing the woman and child to step out into the dimly lit chamber. The woman's eyes shimmered with tears of gratitude as she held her child close. She murmured her thanks to the adventurers, her voice filled with a mixture of relief and awe.</p>
<p>As the group led the woman and child towards the exit, the weight of their heroic actions settled upon their shoulders. They had not only faced the dangers of the crypt but also managed to offer a glimmer of hope to those trapped within its confines.</p>
<p>But their journey was far from over.</p>
<p>Just as they neared the exit, their senses on high alert, the sound of heavy footfalls reverberated through the corridor. Two massive figures emerged from the shadows, their hulking forms unmistakably belonging to bugbears. The air grew thick with tension as the bugbears snarled, their fierce gazes fixed upon the intruders.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/03-bugbear.webp" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="bugbear" src="../images/03-bugbear.webp" /></a></p>
<p>Vaxidd, ever the stalwart protector, stepped forward, his shield held high, ready to defend his companions. The bugbears wasted no time, launching themselves at the adventurers with savage ferocity. Vaxidd valiantly intercepted one of the brutes, his armor absorbing the impact of a bone-crushing blow. Pain seared through his body, but he stood firm, unwavering in his commitment to safeguard his friends.</p>
<p>Sheod swiftly notched an arrow onto his bowstring, taking aim at the second bugbear. His hands trembled slightly, a mixture of adrenaline and determination coursing through his veins. With a focused gaze, he released the arrow, watching as it streaked through the air, finding its mark with deadly precision. The bugbear let out a guttural howl of pain, its momentum faltering for a brief moment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Orianna gracefully danced through the chaos, her rapier glinting in the dim light. With calculated precision, she lunged at the injured bugbear, her blade finding purchase in its flesh. The bugbear let out a final, agonized growl before collapsing to the ground, lifeless.</p>
<p>Mortimer, his magical reservoir nearly depleted, found himself without the familiar tools of his trade. Undeterred, he swiftly withdrew a light crossbow from his side, relying on his keen aim to make up for the absence of his spells. With a deft hand, he took aim at the remaining bugbear and pulled the trigger. The crossbow bolt whistled through the air, finding its mark in the vulnerable flesh of the beast. A pained roar erupted from the bugbear as it staggered backward, momentarily stunned by the unexpected attack.</p>
<p>Sensing an opportunity, Vaxidd capitalized on the bugbear's momentary distraction. With a powerful swing of his warhammer, he brought it crashing down upon the creature's skull, shattering bone and ending its life in a brutal display of strength.</p>
<p>The chamber fell into an eerie silence, broken only by the heavy breathing of the adventurers as they caught their breath. They surveyed the aftermath of the intense battle, the room now painted with the remnants of their triumph. The adrenaline coursing through their veins slowly ebbed away, leaving behind a sense of accomplishment tinged with exhaustion.</p>
<p>Mortimer, his crossbow still clutched tightly in his hand, approached Vaxidd with a mixture of gratitude and concern. "You saved me back there," he said, his voice filled with genuine appreciation. "I owe you my life, my friend."</p>
<p>Vaxidd, wiping a trickle of blood from his brow, offered a weary smile. "We're a team," he replied, his voice laced with the weariness of the battle. "We look out for each other. That's what friends do."</p>
<p>Orianna, her rapier still gleaming with the remnants of her victory, approached the fallen bugbears. Her gaze swept over the lifeless bodies, a mix of solemnity and determination etched upon her face. "These creatures were a threat," she said, her voice carrying a steely resolve. "But now they pose no danger to anyone else. We did what needed to be done."</p>
<p>Sheod, nursing a minor wound from his earlier fall, joined the group, his eyes scanning the surroundings for any signs of further danger. "Let's not linger," he suggested, his voice carrying a note of urgency. "We've dealt with the immediate threats, but we must press on. Our mission is not yet complete."</p>
<h2 id="admitting-defeat">Admitting defeat</h2>
<p>As the group gathered outside the secret crypt's entrance, a mixture of weariness and concern settled upon their faces. Mortimer, still holding his crossbow, spoke up with a tinge of frustration lacing his voice. "I feel utterly useless," he admitted, his brow furrowing in self-doubt. "Out of spells and without healing potions, I'm no more capable than a mere peasant. I couldn't protect any of you back there."</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his armor dented and his body bearing the marks of the battle, placed a comforting hand on Mortimer's shoulder. "Don't be so hard on yourself," he said, his voice filled with empathy. "We all have our limits, and today we fought bravely together. It's not about individual strength but the strength of our unity."</p>
<p>Orianna, her expression a mix of concern and determination, stepped forward. "He's right," she said, her voice steady. "We have faced challenges that tested us to our core, but we can't let our setbacks define us. We need to think strategically, find a way to retreat, and ensure the safety of the woman and child we rescued."</p>
<p>Sheod, assessing the situation with a discerning gaze, nodded in agreement. "There will be consequences from the Redbrand ruffians for the town," he admitted, his voice tinged with regret. "But for now, our priority must be our own well-being and that of those we've rescued. We can't fight an entire battle alone."</p>
<p>With a collective understanding, the adventurers made their way back to the town, their footsteps heavy with the weight of their recent encounters. The air was thick with tension as they navigated the darkened streets, keeping a vigilant eye for any signs of danger.</p>
<p>Finally, they reached their destination—the Twilight's Refuge, the inn owned by Orianna's father. As they stepped inside, a sense of familiarity and relief washed over them. The cozy interior, filled with warm hues and the comforting scent of hearth fire, offered a respite from the outside world.</p>
<p>Orianna's father, a kind and wise man, greeted them with a mixture of concern and relief. His eyes scanned the group, noting their weary and battle-worn appearances. "What has happened?" he inquired, his voice filled with paternal worry.</p>
<p>Sheod stepped forward, his voice steady as he recounted their encounter in the crypt and the subsequent need for retreat. "We need a place to regroup, to tend to our wounds, and to ensure the safety of the woman and child we brought with us," he explained, his gaze meeting Orianna's father's eyes. "We need your inn as our sanctuary."</p>
<p>Orianna's father nodded, understanding etched on his face. "You are always welcome here," he said, his voice filled with unwavering support. "Rest, recover, and know that you have a safe haven within these walls."</p>
<p>The group settled into the comforting embrace of the inn, finding solace in the flickering warmth of the hearth. Their bodies ached from the battles fought, their spirits yearning for respite. They tended to their wounds as best they could, relying on their shared knowledge and limited supplies.</p>
<p>As the night progressed, conversations flowed amidst the weary silence. Mortimer, feeling a renewed sense of purpose, spoke up with determination. "We can't let this setback deter us," he said, his voice filled with conviction. "We need to regroup, replenish our resources, and come back stronger. The town needs us, and we won't let them down."</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his voice resonating with unwavering loyalty, agreed. "We may have stumbled, but we haven't lost sight of our mission," he affirmed, his eyes filled with a steely resolve. "We'll use this time to strategize, to plan our next move. Together, we'll find a way to overcome the Redbrand threat and ensure the safety of this town."</p>
<p>Orianna, her heart swelling with pride at the resilience of her companions, chimed in. "We are a team, bonded not only by the challenges we face but also by our unwavering determination to protect those in need. This setback is just a temporary obstacle. We will rise above it."</p>
<p>As the night deepened, the group found solace in the camaraderie and support they shared. Stories were exchanged, laughter echoed through the inn, and even amidst their exhaustion, a flicker of hope burned within each of them. In the haven of Twilight's Refuge, they knew they were not alone.</p>
<h1 id="day-4">Day 4</h1>
<h2 id="back-to-tresendar-manor">Back to Tresendar Manor</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/04-tresendar-manor.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="tresendar Manor" src="../images/04-tresendar-manor.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>The group awakens to the gentle rustling of leaves and the soft rays of the morning sun filtering through the Inn's window. They rise from their beds, stretching their weary muscles and preparing themselves for another day of travel. The events of the previous day linger in their thoughts, a testament to the dangers that await them in Phandalin.</p>
<p>Sheod, Mortimer, and Vaxidd huddle together, their voices low as they strategize their plan to infiltrate Tresendar Manor once again. The weight of their previous failure still hangs heavy in the air, and they are determined not to make the same mistakes again.</p>
<p>They overhear a few patrons sitting at the inn that they saw torches leaving from the south side of the Manor, where there is an old cave entrance. "We need to find a way back inside the manor without being detected," Sheod whispers, his eyes darting around to ensure their conversation remains private. "If they have torches leaving through the cavern entrance, it might be our best chance to slip back in unnoticed."</p>
<p>Mortimer nods, his brow furrowed in concentration. "Agreed. We'll have to be cautious and move quickly. We can't afford to be caught this time."</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his hand resting on the hilt of his hammer, adds, "I suggest we approach from the side, if they have left during the night, then the place will be mostly unguarded. It's our best shot at getting in."</p>
<p>As they finalize their plan, a sense of determination fills their hearts. They know the risks they are about to face, but their resolve remains unwavering. They understand that their success could mean the difference between life and death, not just for themselves but for the innocents trapped within the manor.</p>
<p>Silently, they make their way toward the cavern entrance. The nearby foliage wraps around them like a cloak, concealing their movements as they traverse the treacherous path. Cautiously, they approach the entrance, their bodies pressed against the cold stone walls. Peering around the corner, they observe torch light flickering.</p>
<p>With a nod of understanding, Sheod takes the lead, his agile form blending seamlessly into the shadows. He moves with a cat-like grace, his steps light and calculated. Mortimer and Vaxidd follow closely behind, their senses heightened and their weapons at the ready.</p>
<p>As they slip through the cavern entrance, the darkness engulfs them. The air grows colder, carrying the scent of damp earth and moss. They rely on their instincts, their eyes adjusting to the limited light filtering through the cracks in the rocky ceiling.</p>
<p>Every step brings them closer to their goal, closer to the heart of the manor where Glasstaff and his Redbrand thugs await. The tension builds with each passing moment, their nerves taut like a drawn bowstring. The weight of their mission rests upon their shoulders, but they are undeterred.</p>
<p>As Sheod, Mortimer, and Vaxidd cautiously traverse the dark corridors of Tresendar Manor, their ears catch a chilling sound that sends shivers down their spines. A low, guttural growl mixed with the sickening sound of flesh being torn apart and bones cracking fills the air. Their hearts pound in their chests as they realize the source of the horrifying noise.</p>
<p>With bated breath, they inch closer to the origin of the sound, their eyes adjusting to the dim light. Peering around a corner, they witness a ghastly sight that threatens to turn their stomachs. A grotesque creature with one bulging eye and disheveled hair, hunches over the mangled corpses of the bugbears they had encountered the day before.</p>
<p>Mortimer's face contorts with both disgust and intrigue as he observes the Nothic's behavior. "It's feeding on them," he whispers, his voice barely audible. "devouring their flesh."</p>
<p>Sheod's grip tightens around his bow, his knuckles turning white. "We must proceed with caution," he advises, his eyes locked on the monstrous creature. Mortimer continues "A Nothic is a formidable foe, and it won't hesitate to attack if it senses our presence. However they are intelligent and capable of reasonning"</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his voice filled with grim determination, adds, "If we are to navigate these treacherous halls and rescue the prisoners, we must find a way to deal with the Nothic. It could prove to be a deadly obstacle if left unchecked."</p>
<p>The trio exchanges a silent, knowing glance, their unspoken agreement cementing their next course of action. They must face the Nothic head-on, confronting the abomination and neutralizing its threat. The lives of the innocent prisoners depend on their success.</p>
<p>With practiced stealth, they advance towards it. Their footsteps are calculated and silent, their breaths held as they approach the lurking creature. The smell of blood and decay grows stronger, mingling with the dampness of the cavernous chamber.</p>
<p>As they reach the entrance to the Nothic's domain, Sheod notches an arrow to his bow, ready to strike if necessary. Mortimer's fingers twitch, longing to unleash a powerful spell, while Vaxidd's shield is raised in a defensive stance, prepared to protect his comrades.</p>
<p>The Nothic, engrossed in its grisly feast, senses their presence. Its milky, bulging eye swivel towards them, fixating on their intruding forms. A low, menacing growl rumbles from its throat, a clear warning to back away.</p>
<p>Mortimer, his voice laced with both apprehension and resolve, takes a step forward. "Nothic, we mean you no harm," he speaks in a measured tone, attempting to quell the creature's hostility. "We seek to aid those imprisoned within this manor. Will you allow us passage?"</p>
<p>The Nothic's response is a guttural hiss, filled with suspicion and hunger. Its gaze shifts from one member of the group to another, its eyes lingering on the gleam of Vaxidd's armor. It seems to weigh their intentions, torn between its insatiable appetite and the potential for alliance.</p>
<p>Vaxidd steps forward, lowering his shield just enough to show that they mean no immediate threat. "We offer you a deal," he proposes, his voice steady. "Assist us in our mission, and we shall provide you with sustenance—fresh meat that does not bear the taint of the Redbrands."</p>
<p>As the Nothic's milky eyes bore into their souls, a peculiar sensation washes over the group. Words form in their minds, a telepathic communication that bypasses spoken language. The Nothic's voice resonates within their heads, filled with a mix of hunger, desperation, and a hint of cunning.</p>
<p>"You offer sustenance and 'shinnies'?" the Nothic's telepathic voice echoes in their minds, its hunger laced with curiosity. "The Redbrands have kept feeding me their discarded corpses and tossing me their Shinnies" The Nothic's tone holds a touch of bitterness, as if it resigns to its current existence.</p>
<p>Mortimer exchanges a glance with his companions, silently acknowledging the potential benefit of striking an alliance with the creature. "We understand your plight," he responds telepathically, projecting a sense of sincerity and empathy. "If we can free the captives and put an end to the Redbrands' tyranny, we will provide you with both fresh sustenance and the shinnies you desire."</p>
<p>The Nothic's eyes narrow, its mind processing the offer. It seems to weigh the potential rewards against the risks. Moments stretch into an eternity before the Nothic finally relents, a hungry anticipation tinging its thoughts. "Agreed," it conveys, its voice resonating with a mix of hunger and anticipation. "Bring me the shinnies you find, and feed me the flesh of your defeated foes. I will not harm you"</p>
<p>The group, relieved that their negotiation has reached a positive outcome, exchanges glances of both caution and determination. They understand that this partnership, however reluctant, might be the key to success in their mission. They cautiously step closer to the Nothic, signaling their acceptance of the agreement.</p>
<p>"We shall honor our pact," Vaxidd speaks, his voice projected silently to the Nothic. "But remember, our ultimate goal is to rid this place of the Redbrands and ensure the safety of the innocents they have assaulted. We expect your cooperation in achieving that."</p>
<p>The Nothic's eyes gleam with a mix of hunger and an odd flicker of gratitude. The group can sense that the creature, bound by its insatiable desires, still recognizes the opportunity presented to it. It nods, a grotesque twitch of its misshapen head, acknowledging its role in their shared endeavor.</p>
<p>With the agreement reached, the group proceeds deeper into the manor, the Nothic's presence a constant reminder of their fragile alliance. As they continue their perilous journey, they can't help but wonder if they can truly trust the creature that lurks behind them. Only time will reveal the true nature of this unholy alliance and the impact it will have on their quest to liberate Phandalin from the clutches of the Redbrands.</p>
<h2 id="crashing-the-party">Crashing the party</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/04-gambling.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="gambling" src="../images/04-gambling.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>As the Nothic greedily feasts on the remnants of the bugbear's flesh, its elongated claws tearing into the bones with a sickening crunch, the party cautiously ventures forth. Each step taken with a mixture of trepidation and determination, they press deeper into the depths of the manor, their senses alert and hearts pounding.</p>
<p>Descending a flight of worn stone stairs, the group enters a desolate room. It is a barracks, its atmosphere heavy with the stench of unwashed bodies and rotting meat. Four crudely constructed wooden bunks line the walls, their surfaces cluttered with disheveled blankets and scattered dirty dishes. The air hangs thick with the lingering residue of forgotten lives, abandoned in the wake of the Redbrands' tyranny.</p>
<p>Mortimer's nose wrinkles in disgust as he takes in the scene. "This place reeks of decay and despair," he mutters, his voice laced with a hint of sorrow. "It's a grim reminder of the suffering inflicted upon this town."</p>
<p>Vaxidd surveys the room, his eyes scanning for any signs of danger. "Indeed," he replies, his voice filled with determination. "But let us not dwell on the desolation. We must press on, for there are innocents to save and justice to be served."</p>
<p>With renewed resolve, the group moves past the empty barracks and continues along the winding tunnel. Their footsteps echo softly, each one a testament to their unwavering commitment to the task at hand. As they approach the next door, anticipation and tension fill the air.</p>
<p>The door creaks open, revealing a spacious chamber adorned with worn tables and chairs. The flickering glow of candlelight dances upon the walls, casting an ethereal ambiance upon the scene. Draperies of brown and red adorn the weathered walls, lending a touch of faded grandeur to the space. Wooden benches are positioned against the walls, their weary presence a silent testament to the gatherings that once took place within these walls.</p>
<p>In the center of the room, four rugged warriors, their scarlet cloaks a stark contrast against the dim surroundings, gather around a table. Coins and trinkets are stacked upon its surface, forming a glittering pile of ill-gotten gains. The warriors' voices carry a mixture of laughter and boastful banter, their eyes glinting with the thrill of their deeds.</p>
<p>Sheod's grip tightens around the hilt of his bow as he takes in the scene. A fire burns within his eyes, fueled by a combination of anger and determination. "These Redbrands mock the very essence of honor and decency," he whispers, his voice filled with quiet intensity. "We must put an end to their reign of terror."</p>
<p>Orianna, her fingers twitching with a desire to strum her lute, can't help but feel a pang of empathy for the innocents affected by the Redbrands' actions. "They have feasted upon the suffering of others for far too long," she murmurs, her voice resonating with a mix of determination and sorrow. "It's time we restore hope and bring an end to their wicked ways."</p>
<p>The group exchanges a knowing glance, their unspoken agreement fueling their collective resolve. With their weapons drawn and their spirits fortified, they step forward, ready to confront the Redbrand warriors and reclaim the stolen treasures. For within the depths of this room, the seeds of a pivotal battle have been sown, where the forces of justice and righteousness stand poised to confront the darkness that threatens to consume Phandalin.</p>
<p>Within the dimly lit chamber, the atmosphere grows tense as the characters step into the room. The air thickens with the scent of alcohol, the remnants of a heavy drinking session that has left the Redbrand ruffians inebriated and on the brink of hostility. Knucklebones clatter upon the table, their game teetering on the edge of turning acrimonious, as most gambling endeavors do.</p>
<p>Sheod, his bow at the ready, seizes the opportunity for a decisive strike. With a swift and precise movement, an arrow is unleashed from his bowstring, finding its mark with deadly accuracy. It pierces through the neck of one of the ruffians, causing him to stagger backward, his lifeblood staining his scarlet cloak.</p>
<p>The remaining three ruffians, fueled by a potent mix of liquor and fury, leap over the table, their eyes fixed upon the doorway where Sheod stands. Their intentions are clear—swift vengeance for their fallen comrade. </p>
<p>However, Mortimer, ever resourceful, conjures an illusionary image of a swirling cloak, an ethereal apparition that confuses one of the ruffians at the crucial moment. The ruffian's strike misses its intended target, the cloak dissipating into mist as the illusion fades.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, muscles bulging beneath his armor, charges forward with resolute determination. Pushing past Sheod, he unleashes a devastating blow upon one of the ruffians. The force of his hammer connecting with flesh and bone is thunderous, and the ruffian crumples to the ground, life extinguished.</p>
<p>The remaining two ruffians, their faces etched with fear and desperation, seize the opportunity to escape. They dart towards a concealed back door, their fleeting forms a blur of panic and self-preservation. Sheod and Vaxidd give chase, their determination driving them forward. But the ruffians prove nimble, disappearing into the shadows beyond their reach.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mortimer remains in the room, his gaze shifting towards the table where the spoils of their wicked deeds lie heaped. The stolen wealth, amassed through deceit and ill-gotten gains, gleams under the flickering candlelight. Coins and trinkets, symbols of the ruffians' greed, glimmer enticingly before him.</p>
<p>With a sigh, Mortimer joins Sheod and Vaxidd back in the room, their pursuit having yielded no capture. Their faces bear the frustration of a missed opportunity, but their resolve remains unyielding. It is not vengeance they seek, but justice and the restoration of peace to Phandalin.</p>
<p>As they resume their investigation, their attention shifts once more to the room, to the wealth that adorns the table. It is a tangible reminder of the Redbrands' callous disregard for the well-being of the townsfolk. And while the battle may be temporarily stalled, their determination to see justice served burns brighter than ever.</p>
<p>With cautious steps, they approach the table, their hands reaching out to claim what was stolen. The weight of the coins and trinkets feels significant, not only in their material value but also in the symbolism it carries. Each piece of wealth reclaimed is a small victory, a step closer to dismantling the Redbrands' grip on the town and restoring hope to its inhabitants.</p>
<p>In this room, where blood has been spilled and fortunes gambled away, the trio stands united, their collective purpose undeterred. The path ahead may be fraught with danger and uncertainty, but their spirits remain unyielding, their resolve unshakable. Together, they will uncover the truth, face the challenges that lie ahead, and bring light to the darkness that has plagued Phandalin for far too long.</p>
<h2 id="the-laboratory">The Laboratory</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/04-laboratory.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="laboratory" src="../images/04-laboratory.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>The party cautiously approaches the next door, their ears attuned to the faint bubbling and dripping sounds emanating from within the room. With a collective breath, they push the door open, revealing a sight that immediately captures their attention.</p>
<p>Before them lies a wizard's workshop, an array of alchemical apparatus and arcane tools scattered across the room. The pungent scent of potions fills the air, mingling with the faint aroma of brewing ingredients. The room hums with a palpable energy, the bubbling and hissing of the alchemical concoctions creating an auditory symphony.</p>
<p>Each contraption bubbles and steams, their contents a swirling cauldron of vibrant colors and enigmatic mixtures. It is evident that whoever has claimed this space is deeply devoted to the mastery of potion brewing and alchemy.</p>
<p>Mortimer's eyes light up with curiosity and intrigue as he surveys the room. His keen intellect recognizes the nature of the apparatus, the setup specifically designed for the delicate process of brewing potions of invisibility. However, it becomes apparent that the alchemist's attempts thus far have been met with limited success.</p>
<p>As the party further explores the room, their attention is drawn to the bookshelves brimming with parchment and tomes of arcane knowledge. The shelves are a treasure trove of alchemical texts, offering glimpses into the intricate art of potion-making. Mortimer, proficient in Arcana, examines the materials with a discerning eye, recognizing the fundamental texts on alchemy that line the shelves.</p>
<p>Amidst the collection, his gaze falls upon a tome written in the ancient script of Dwarvish. Intrigued, Mortimer carefully retrieves the journal and begins to decipher its contents. The tome reveals itself to be the journal of an adventurer named Urmon, its worn pages chronicling the rich history of the Lost Mine of Phandelver and the legendary Forge of Spells.</p>
<p>Page after page, Mortimer's eyes devour the words, learning of the ancient alliance between gnomes, dwarves, and mages known as Phandelver's Pact. He discovers that the priests of Lathander, the god of dawn, had commissioned a magical mace named Lightbringer from the skilled artisans involved in the pact. This divine weapon, imbued with the power of radiant light, was crafted to vanquish darkness and bring hope to the world.</p>
<p>The journal reveals a somber truth—a truth that resonates deeply within the hearts of the party. It speaks of the mace's unfortunate fate, lost to time and the enigmatic disappearance of Wave Echo Cave and its mine. The weight of this knowledge settles upon them, the potential significance of Lightbringer in their quest for justice and the restoration of Phandalin's prosperity becoming apparent.</p>
<p>Within the wizard's workshop, amidst the alchemical wonders and the forgotten history inscribed within the journal, the party feels a stirring sense of purpose. They recognize that the path they tread leads not only to uncovering the truth of the Redbrands' tyranny but also to unearthing the remnants of a forgotten legacy. The mace, Lightbringer, serves as a beacon of hope, awaiting rediscovery within the depths of Wave Echo Cave.</p>
<p>With renewed determination, the party continues their exploration, their minds and hearts aflame with the knowledge they have gained. They understand that their journey extends beyond the mundane and into realms steeped in magic, prophecy, and the echoes of a forgotten time. The wizard's workshop becomes a testament to the vast possibilities that lie ahead, propelling them closer to the answers they seek and the destiny that awaits</p>
<p>As the party pushes open the door at the end of the wizard's workshop, they are met with the sight of a lavishly decorated bedchamber. The walls are adorned with scarlet drapes that cascade down, creating a sense of opulence. The room exudes an air of comfort and relaxation, with a small writing desk and a matching chair placed near the window, inviting moments of quiet contemplation. A large, comfortable-looking bed takes center stage, adorned with richly embroidered sheets and plush pillows. At the foot of the bed rests a sturdy wooden chest, beckoning the curious adventurers.</p>
<p>With a mix of anticipation and caution, the party begins to explore the room. Their attention is immediately drawn to the neat stack of papers and notes resting upon the desk. 
Mortimer: "Look at these papers. They're orders to alchemists and apothecaries. GlassStaff has been busy stocking up his workshop. The meticulous nature of the notes hints at the dedication and expertise of this enigmatic figure. Seems like he's trying to master the art of brewing potions and concoctions. Though from what I can tell, he hasn't quite succeeded yet."</p>
<p>However, it is the discovery of a particular letter that sends a shiver down their spines. Signed with the symbol of the Black Spider, the letter bears the name Lord Albrek as the recipient. Sheod reads it aloud. "This letter... Lord Albrek, the Black Spider's agent, is instructing GlassStaff to capture or kill any strangers who could be working for the dwarves. And he wants any dwarven maps delivered to him. Iarno is Glass Staff."</p>
<p>The gravity of the situation weighs heavily upon the party's shoulders. The realization that their presence in Phandalin has not gone unnoticed ignites a sense of danger and urgency within them. They understand that their quest for justice and the restoration of peace in the town is intertwined with a much larger tapestry of power and manipulation.</p>
<p>Yet, amidst the somber atmosphere, their eyes catch a glimmer of hope. At the foot of Iarno's bed lies a sturdy, unlocked wooden chest, promising treasures untold. With a mix of anticipation and caution, they approach the chest and slowly lift its lid.</p>
<p>Inside, a gleam of golden coins catches their eyes, accompanied by the twinkle of small jewels. "Golden coins and precious jewels" says Sheod "These are the spoils of the Redbrands' wicked deeds." Among the treasures are two exquisite ruby earrings, their vibrant red hue a stark contrast against the surrounding wealth. It is a tangible reminder of the Redbrands' ill-gotten gains, their greed and malice now exposed.</p>
<p>Vaxidd picks up the earrings "These earrings are exquisite. We should set them aside. We promised the Nothic some 'shinnies,' remember?" They retrieve a few silver pieces and the precious ruby earrings, setting them aside for their peculiar ally. The act serves as a testament to their honor and integrity, an acknowledgment of their bond forged amidst the shadows of Phandalin.</p>
<p>In this bedchamber, the characters stand on the precipice of greater revelations and challenges. The letter and the chest hold keys to uncovering the truth and dismantling the web of darkness that plagues the town. With renewed determination, they take a collective breath, ready to face the impending trials and confront the insidious forces that seek to thwart their every step.</p>
<p>The party's footsteps echo through the dimly lit corridors as they meticulously scour every nook and cranny of the dungeon beneath Tresendar Manor. Their eyes dart from one shadowy corner to the next, anticipation mingling with caution. The air is heavy with a sense of trepidation, as if the very walls hold secrets waiting to be unveiled.</p>
<p>Mortimer's fingers brush against the cold stone walls, his touch lingering in search of hidden passages. Vaxidd's heavy boots echo with purpose, his hammer held firmly in his grasp, ready for any confrontation. And Sheod, ever the watchful ranger, scans the surroundings, his sharp eyes piercing through the darkness. </p>
<p>As they enter the main chamber, a sense of anticipation fills the air. Their gazes converge on the fountain, where a wet rope lies haphazardly discarded next to it. It is a telltale sign that someone has retrieved an item from the depths of the fountain and hastily made their escape. Sheod, his brows furrowing with determination, steps forward to examine the evidence. "Someone has been here, and they've taken something of value. We must find out what it was and who took it."</p>
<p>The party's footsteps hasten as they make their way through the dungeon, their minds racing with questions. Inside the manor, they find the two ruffians they had previously locked away, their eyes filled with desperation and fear. "Please, let us go! We won't cause any more trouble, we swear!" Sheod, his voice laced with a menacing edge, steps closer, his presence commanding attention. "You two have one chance to redeem yourselves. Tell us everything you know about the whereabouts of the rest of the Redbrands. Conceal nothing, for your lives hang in the balance."</p>
<p>"Alright, alright! Most of them have left, including our leader, a towering green bugbear. But we don't know where they've gone. We swear!" The party's expressions shift, a mix of frustration and relief washing over their faces. They had hoped for more information, but it seems their captives have reached the limit of their knowledge.</p>
<p>After an intense session of interrogation, the decision is made to lock the ruffians away in the village's jail, ensuring they pose no further threat to Phandalin. With the ruffians secured, the party emerges from Tresendar Manor, their footsteps carrying them back to the heart of the town. Mortimer, his voice tinged with determination, addresses his companions. "Our journey beneath Tresendar Manor may not have yielded all the answers we sought, but we have taken a step towards reclaiming peace for Phandalin. Let us regroup, gather our thoughts, and chart our next course of action."</p>
<p>The sun casts its warm glow upon the village as the party makes their way through the bustling streets. Determined to uncover the truth and protect the innocent, they press on, their spirits unyielding despite the challenges that lie ahead. In this pivotal moment, the fate of Phandalin rests upon their shoulders, and they are prepared to face whatever trials await them in the pursuit of justice.</p>
<h2 id="victorious">Victorious</h2>
<p>As the sun reaches it's zenith, our weary adventurers make their triumphant return. The streets are alive with the joyful chatter of villagers going about their daily routines. News of their courageous exploits has spread like wildfire, and the townsfolk gather to greet them, their eyes filled with gratitude and admiration.</p>
<p>Mayor Harbin Wester, a portly man with a kind face, stands at the entrance of the town hall, ready to receive the captured ruffians. The adventurers march forward, their strides purposeful and determined, as the two ruffians shuffle along, their heads hung low in defeat. The mayor nods approvingly, acknowledging the bravery of our heroes. "You have brought peace to our humble town, my friends." says the Mayor "These ruffians will face justice for their crimes. We are indebted to you."</p>
<p>The villagers, young and old, line the streets, clapping and cheering for the returning champions. Their voices intertwine, forming a chorus of gratitude that resonates in the hearts of our adventurers. They stand tall, humbled by the villagers' appreciation, their eyes reflecting a mixture of pride and humility.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his voice filled with warmth, addresses the villagers. "We are but humble servants of justice, dear friends. It is through unity and courage that we have achieved this small victory. Together, we shall overcome any challenge that dares to threaten your beloved Phandalin."</p>
<p>The crowd erupts in applause, their cheers echoing through the town square. The adventurers take a moment to bask in the warmth of the villagers' gratitude, their chests swelling with a sense of fulfillment.</p>
<p>As the celebrations subside, the adventurers disperse to attend to their individual needs. Mortimer, with a gleam in his eyes, heads towards the local merchant, eager to sell the spoils of their hard-fought battles. Vaxidd, feeling the weight of his hammer, seeks solace at the inn, yearning for a well-deserved rest and a hearty meal. Sheod, ever vigilant, scans the crowd for any sign of trouble, his ranger instincts still sharp even in moments of respite.</p>
<p>Just as they begin to settle into the familiar rhythms of the town, Sister Garaele, the gentle elven priestess, approaches them with a look of gratitude upon her face. She extends her delicate hand, offering a small silver comb adorned with intricate carvings.</p>
<p>Sister Garaele: "I cannot express my gratitude enough for your valiant deeds. But there is one more task that requires your aid. Agatha, the reclusive banshee, holds the knowledge we seek. Take this silver comb as an offering. It may help in persuading her to share the location of the spellbook we seek."</p>
<p>The adventurers exchange glances, a mixture of curiosity and determination flickering in their eyes. They accept the comb, acknowledging the weight of the task that lies ahead.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his voice filled with resolve, speaks on behalf of the group. "We hav not fogotten what we agreed, Sister. We shall not falter. The path to knowledge is often veiled, but we will tread it with courage and diplomacy. Thank you for entrusting us with this crucial mission."</p>
<p>With a gentle nod, Sister Garaele bids them farewell, her ethereal presence fading into the fabric of the town. The adventurers exchange a knowing glance, their spirits reinvigorated by the sense of purpose that lingers in the air.</p>
<h2 id="travelling-to-see-the-ghost">Travelling to see the ghost</h2>
<p>As they embark on their new quest, the streets of Phandalin whisper tales of their valor and resilience. They carry the hopes of the villagers on their shoulders, their hearts brimming with determination. Through the trials that lie ahead, our intrepid adventurers venture forth, their footsteps echoing in the quiet evening streets of Phandalin. The weight of their previous triumphs and the burden of their new mission mingle within them, fueling their determination to seek out the reclusive banshee known as Agatha.</p>
<p>Under the tranquil glow of a crescent moon, they find themselves at the edge of the village, where the path meanders into ancient woods. The air grows thick with an aura of mysticism, and a gentle breeze carries whispers of forgotten tales and untold secrets.</p>
<p>Sheod, leading the way with his keen senses, guides the party deeper into the forest. The towering trees seem to stretch their branches as if in curiosity, casting dancing shadows upon the adventurers as they traverse the winding trail. A sense of reverence envelops them, a reminder of the ancient powers that dwell within this realm.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his grip firm on his trusty hammer, gazes ahead, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of anticipation and caution. "We must approach Agatha with respect and humility. Banshees are known for their capricious nature. Let us tread lightly and choose our words wisely."</p>
<p>Mortimer, his mind brimming with arcane knowledge, nods in agreement, his steps light and purposeful. "Indeed, Vaxidd. Diplomacy shall be our weapon. Agatha holds the key to the hidden spellbook, and it is through understanding and mutual benefit that we shall unlock her wisdom."</p>
<h2 id="the-dancing-ogre">The Dancing Ogre</h2>
<p>The sun began its descent, casting a warm, golden glow upon the adventurers as they embarked on their journey to seek Agatha's wisdom. The path ahead meandered through the untamed wilderness, its verdant beauty interwoven with a sense of mystery and trepidation. The air was thick with anticipation, as if the very forest held its breath in anticipation of the heroes' quest.</p>
<p>Days turned into nights, and the weather shifted with whimsical caprice. The adventurers trudged forward, their determination unyielding, guided by maps and sheer instinct. The dense foliage enveloped them, casting dappled shadows upon their path, as if nature itself whispered secrets and warnings in their ears.</p>
<p>As the first day of their journey neared its end, the distant echoes of grunting, huffing, and pounding feet reached their ears. Curiosity piqued, the adventurers moved closer, their cautious steps leading them to a clearing bathed in flickering firelight. There, they beheld a sight that gave pause to their hearts.</p>
<p>An ogre, towering and brutish, performed a primal dance around a roaring bonfire. His muscular frame moved with uncanny agility, each stomp resonating with raw power. The adventurers exchanged wary glances, deliberating their next move, whether to engage or to slip by unnoticed.</p>
<p>“Alright, folks, we've stumbled upon an ogre doing some sort of tribal ritual. Thoughts on our next move?” Vaxidd said.
Sheod, not taking his eyes off the ogre “I say we charge right in there, swords swinging! No need for fancy footwork when you've got a solid battle strategy”
Mortimer grabbed his forehead and sighed ”Let's not rush into this like a pack of northern barbarians. We should tread carefully.”
“I've tangled with giants and ogres before, and they can be quite the handful” added Vaxidd ”We need to approach with caution and a well-thought-out plan”
“That’s why you should go in front” replied Mortimer.
“He’s the one that’s thinks a solid battle strategy is running head first into an Ogre. Maybe the ogre will be so amused by his audacity he will laugh itself to death” Vaxidd pointed to Sheod.
Sheod grinned, his eyes gleaming with excitement. “Now that’s a battle plan I can get behind! Imagine the legends they’ll tell about the fearless warrior who vaquished an ogre with his sheer audacity and irresistible charm.”
Mortimer rolled his eyes, a mix of exhasperation and amusement crossing his face. “Oh yes, Sheod, I’m sure the bards will compose ballads about the ogre’s who starved tp death, because after he splattered the elf who charged him headfirst was splattered so hard there was nothing left.”</p>
<p>Before a decision could be reached, the ogre's keen senses detected their presence. With a thunderous roar, he lunged forward, his massive club raised high, hungering for the taste of battle.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, fueled by a protective instinct, surged forward, his hammer held high in defiance of the looming threat. The clash was fierce, as the ogre's grip closed around Vaxidd's sturdy form, dragging him toward the searing flames of the bonfire.</p>
<p>Agonized cries filled the air as Vaxidd dangled precariously over the crackling inferno. Sheod, his eyes focused and arrow ready, took aim with unwavering precision. His shot rang true, piercing the ogre's flesh and forcing a momentary release of his captive.</p>
<p>Mortimer, in a surge of arcane energy, unleashed bolts of magic that crackled through the air, striking the ogre with an otherworldly force. The colossal creature relinquished its hold, but not without leaving Vaxidd sprawled on the ground, unconscious and wounded.</p>
<p>Fear and determination mingled within Mortimer's eyes as he cast a desperate sleep spell, a shimmering aura of magic emanating from his outstretched hands. The ogre's heavy eyelids drooped, his massive frame succumbing to the spell's enchanting grasp.</p>
<p>“He won’t be out for long, Sheod!” Mortimer shouted!</p>
<p>Sheod leapt to Vaxidd lying on the ground, and pulled out a vial from his belt and uncorked it, letting the potion’s contents into Vaxidd’s open lips. Immediately his scorch marks receded, leaving only marks of soot on clean skin, and Vaxidd’s eyes blinked into consciousness, and he sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>“Quick, let’s douse him in oil!” Sheod shouted, already reaching for his pack and distributing flasks of dark sludgy oil. their contents doused upon the slumbering ogre's hulking form. With a log from the bonfire as their catalyst, the adventurers ignited the makeshift pyre, flames engulfing the once-menacing giant.</p>
<p>They watched from a safe distance as the ogre awoke, writhed in agony, its bellows of pain echoing through the night. Within moments, the battle-weary brute succumbed to the searing inferno, collapsing in a smoldering heap.</p>
<p>Breathing heavily, the adventurers gathered around Vaxidd, their hands trembling with a mixture of relief and concern. They tended to his wounds with utmost care, their camaraderie and determination fortifying their spirits.</p>
<p>As they resumed their journey, the flickering light of the vanquished bonfire danced in their eyes, a reminder of their resilience and the price they were willing to pay in pursuit of their quest. Agatha's sanctuary awaited.</p>
<h2 id="a-restless-night">A restless night</h2>
<p>The weary adventurers settled down, their bodies yearning for rest after a long day of perilous travel. The campfire crackled softly, casting dancing shadows upon the surrounding trees, as they took turns keeping watch through the night.</p>
<p>As the others slumbered, Vaxidd the paladin remained awake, his mind awash with thoughts and contemplation. He gazed into the flickering flames, mulling over the choices he had made, questioning the path he had embarked upon. Little did he know that his introspection would soon be interrupted by a divine presence.</p>
<p>In a shimmering cascade of ethereal light, Moradin, the God, appeared before Vaxidd. Awe and reverence filled the air as the paladin knelt, a mix of anticipation and trepidation coursing through his veins.</p>
<p>"Vaxidd," Moradin's voice resonated with a mixture of compassion and authority. "I have witnessed your journey, your struggles and triumphs. Your dedication to your cause has not gone unnoticed, and I offer you a boon, a surge of power to aid you in your quest."</p>
<p>Vaxidd's eyes widened in astonishment, his heart racing with anticipation. He listened intently as Moradin continued, revealing the conditions of this divine gift.</p>
<p>"I bestow upon you a sacred oath, a set of principles that will guide your actions and shape your destiny. Swear to uphold these virtues, and your strength shall be amplified, your purpose bolstered."</p>
<p>With a solemn nod, Vaxidd affirmed his willingness to accept the oath, his voice steady and resolute. "I accept your boon, Moradin. I swear to uphold these virtues and embody them in my every deed."</p>
<p>Moradin's ethereal form radiated with approval as he laid out the tenets of the oath, each word echoing with unwavering conviction.</p>
<p>"Honesty. Let not lies or deceit taint your tongue. May your word be a steadfast promise, and your actions be a reflection of truth."</p>
<p>Vaxidd nodded, his eyes gleaming with a newfound determination. "I shall be honest in all my dealings, embracing the power of truth."</p>
<p>"Courage. Fear not to act, but remember the wisdom of caution. Let bravery guide your steps, even in the face of adversity."</p>
<p>Vaxidd's hand tightened around the hilt of his trusted sword, his resolve solidifying. "I will face each challenge with unwavering courage, tempered by the wisdom of discernment."</p>
<p>"Compassion. Extend your hand to aid others, protect the weak, and bring justice to those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but let it be guided by wisdom."</p>
<p>A soft warmth filled Vaxidd's heart as he embraced the virtue of compassion. "I shall be a shield for the vulnerable, a beacon of justice and mercy intertwined."</p>
<p>"Honor. Treat others with fairness, allowing your honorable deeds to serve as an example. Seek to do good while causing the least amount of harm."</p>
<p>Vaxidd straightened his posture, his eyes gleaming with the promise of honorable conduct. "I shall be guided by honor, treating all with fairness, and striving to leave a legacy of righteousness.”</p>
<p>"Duty. Be accountable for your actions and their consequences. Protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who wield just authority."</p>
<p>Vaxidd's voice resonated with solemnity as he acknowledged the weight of his responsibilities. "I shall embrace my duty, upholding my obligations and safeguarding those who rely on my protection."</p>
<p>With the oath spoken, Moradin's form began to fade, but not before addressing the paladin's lingering doubts.</p>
<p>"Vaxidd, you have faced darkness and made choices that tested your resolve. Remember, redemption lies not in the absence of mistakes, but in the recognition of them. You have shed blood and shared the company of individuals with complicated backgrounds, but it is in your actions moving forward that your true character shall shine."</p>
<p>Vaxidd's brow furrowed as he pondered Moradin's words, realizing the weight of his past decisions and the complexities of his companions. "I understand, Moradin. I will carry this knowledge with me, seeking wisdom in discerning the true nature of those around me, and making choices that align with the path I have sworn to uphold."</p>
<p>With a final nod of approval, Moradin vanished, leaving Vaxidd alone with a renewed sense of purpose and a deeper understanding of the challenges he would face. Determined to honor his oath, he roused old Mortimer from his slumber, gently shaking his shoulder to wake him for his turn at watch.</p>
<p>Mortimer blinked sleepily, rubbing his eyes as he adjusted to the waking world. "What's the matter, Vaxidd? Is it time already?"</p>
<p>Vaxidd's gaze held a newfound intensity as he looked into Mortimer's eyes. "It is, my friend. But before we switch positions, I must share with you the oath I have just taken, bestowed upon me by Moradin himself."</p>
<p>Mortimer sat up, his curiosity piqued. "Moradin? What kind of oath?"</p>
<p>Vaxidd took a deep breath, his voice steady and resolute. "An oath of honesty, courage, compassion, honor, and duty. I have sworn to uphold these virtues in my actions and to let them guide my path."</p>
<p>Mortimer's eyebrows arched in surprise, a mixture of admiration and skepticism crossing his features. "Well, that's quite the commitment, my paladin friend. But I've seen your dedication firsthand. I have faith that you will stay true to your word."</p>
<p>Vaxidd nodded gratefully, the weight of his oath settling upon his shoulders. "Thank you, Mortimer. Your trust means a great deal to me. With Moradin's boon, I believe we can face whatever challenges lie ahead."</p>
<p>Mortimer rose to his feet, stretching his limbs and grabbing his staff. "Well then, let's not keep the night waiting. You rest, my friend. I'll keep watch and ensure our safety."</p>
<p>As Vaxidd settled into his bedroll, his mind swirled with thoughts of the oath, the trials he had faced, and the future that lay before them. He closed his eyes, the flickering images of Moradin's visage and the weight of his newfound responsibility etching themselves into his consciousness.</p>
<p>In the quiet of the night, as Mortimer stood vigilant and the stars painted patterns across the sky, Vaxidd's dreams were filled with visions of a world where honesty, courage, compassion, honor, and duty intertwined seamlessly, guiding his every step. And with each passing moment, he grew more determined to make that vision a reality.</p>
<p>As the darkness wrapped around the camp, Mortimer settled into his watch, a sense of anticipation bubbling within him. He reached for his worn spellbook, its pages filled with countless scribbles and arcane symbols. With a glimmer of excitement in his eyes, he opened it to a marked section and began poring over the notes he had jotted down.</p>
<p>Hours passed by, the quiet night broken only by the crackling of the campfire and the rustling of leaves in the breeze. Mortimer's focus remained unyielding as he studied the intricate glyphs scrawled across the weathered pages. He traced the lines with his finger, his mind delving deep into the mysteries of magic.</p>
<p>And then, like a flickering candle suddenly blazing to life, a surge of understanding washed over Mortimer. The pieces of the puzzle fell into place, and he comprehended the true meaning behind the glyphs he had inscribed. Excitement coursed through his veins as he realized the potential within his grasp.</p>
<p>With a whispered incantation, Mortimer summoned a hand made of compacted soil, rising from the earth before him. It towered above him, its fingers twitching and flexing under his control. He marveled at the intricate manipulation, the power surging through his very being. With a satisfied smile, he dismissed the earthen hand, watching as it crumbled back into the ground.</p>
<p>Eager to continue his exploration of magic's vast realm, Mortimer delved deeper into his spellbook. His eyes widened as he stumbled upon a method to emulate the fiery breath of a dragon. A mischievous grin crept across his face as he imagined the surprise on their enemies' faces when faced with his newfound ability.</p>
<p>As the night wore on and Mortimer's watch came to an end, he gently shook Sheod awake from his meditaton, his voice laced with excitement. "Sheod, my friend, it's time for your turn. But before you take over, let me share with you the discoveries I've made."</p>
<p>Sheod, groggy and bleary-eyed, peered at Mortimer, intrigue evident in his expression. "What did you find, Mortimer? Your enthusiasm is contagious."</p>
<p>Mortimer beckoned Sheod closer, his voice hushed with a mix of awe and delight. "I've unlocked the secrets of these ancient glyphs, my friend. Behold!" With a flourish, he summoned the earthen hand once more, commanding it to dance and twist in the air.</p>
<p>Sheod's eyes widened in astonishment as he watched the display. "By the webs of Lolth! That's remarkable, Mortimer. A truly unexpected talent you possess."</p>
<p>Mortimer nodded, his voice tinged with excitement. "But that's not all. I've also discovered a way to emulate the fire-breath of dragons. Imagine the havoc we can wreak upon our foes!"</p>
<p>Sheod's lips curled into a wicked grin, his dark eyes gleaming with anticipation. "Oh, I can already envision the chaos, my friend. This newfound power of yours will undoubtedly catch our enemies off guard."</p>
<p>As Mortimer handed over the watch to Sheod, a sense of satisfaction washed over him. He had unearthed hidden knowledge and tapped into the very essence of magic itself. With each passing day, his abilities grew, and the realm of possibilities expanded before him.</p>
<p>With a pat on Sheod's shoulder, Mortimer bid him farewell. "May your watch be uneventful, my friend. Explore the shadows and the depths of your own skills. Who knows what wonders we shall discover in the days to come."</p>
<p>And with that, Mortimer retreated to his bedroll, a twinkle of excitement in his eyes, eager to embrace the realm of dreams and delve further into his newfound magical revelations.</p>
<p>As Mortimer nestled into his bedroll, the flickering flames of the campfire casting dancing shadows across his face, he closed his eyes, allowing his mind to wander. The echoes of ancient incantations whispered through his thoughts, guiding him deeper into the recesses of his imagination.</p>
<p>In the realm of dreams, Mortimer found himself standing atop a mountaintop, bathed in the soft glow of a vibrant sunrise. He extended his arms, feeling the mystical energies pulsating around him, intertwining with the very fabric of his being. The knowledge he had acquired, the power that now coursed through his veins, felt almost tangible in this ethereal realm.</p>
<p>A majestic dragon soared through the skies, its scales gleaming like burnished gold. The creature's fiery breath engulfed the landscape below, painting the world in hues of red and orange. Mortimer watched in awe, his heart pounding with exhilaration as he imagined himself harnessing such immense power.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the dragon turned its gaze towards Mortimer, its intelligent eyes locking onto his own. With a voice that reverberated through his very soul, the dragon spoke, its words resonating with ancient wisdom. "Mortimer, mortal of magic, you have glimpsed the essence of true power. Embrace it, wield it with both caution and audacity, and the world shall tremble before you."</p>
<p>Mortimer's breath caught in his throat, the weight of the dragon's words settling upon him. He nodded, a renewed determination shining in his eyes. "I shall, mighty dragon. I shall embrace this power and use it wisely, for the betterment of our cause."</p>
<p>The dragon's piercing gaze softened, a semblance of approval evident in its eyes. "Remember, Mortimer, true strength lies not only in the spells we cast but also in the bonds we forge. The loyalty and trust of your companions will be your greatest assets on this journey."</p>
<p>With those final words of guidance, the dream began to fade, the dragon's form dissipating into a wisp of ethereal smoke.</p>
<p>As the night draped its dark veil over the camp, Sheod settled into his watch, his senses heightened. The rhythmic symphony of nature enveloped him, and he found himself captivated by the nocturnal orchestra that surrounded him. His keen eyes scanned the shadows, his ears attuned to the slightest rustle of leaves.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze stirred the foliage, carrying with it the whispers of the creatures of the night. And in that moment, Sheod's perception shifted, as if a key had unlocked a hidden realm of communication. The chaotic chorus of night animals, once a mysterious cacophony of sounds, now wove a tapestry of meaning within his mind.</p>
<p>His heart raced with excitement as he realized the gift bestowed upon him. Sheod possessed the ability to understand and converse with the creatures that roamed the wilderness. It was a connection to the natural world that few adventurers ever experienced. He listened intently, his senses attuned to the intricate nuances of their conversations.</p>
<p>The wise owl perched on a nearby branch hooted a message of wisdom, sharing secrets of the ancient forest. The mischievous squirrels chattered in a playful tone, beckoning Sheod to join their lively games. Even the stealthy fox, its eyes gleaming with cunning, shared tales of hidden paths and elusive prey.</p>
<p>As the watch came to an end, the soft hues of dawn began to paint the sky, casting a gentle glow over the camp. Sheod's heart brimmed with excitement and a newfound connection to the natural world. He couldn't wait to share this extraordinary revelation with his companions, to let them in on the enchanting conversations that unfolded in the depths of the night.</p>
<p>With a mischievous smile playing on his lips, Sheod gently roused his slumbering companions. One by one, they emerged from their rest, stretching their limbs and rubbing the sleep from their eyes. Their gazes settled upon Sheod, curiosity etched upon their faces.</p>
<p>Vaxidd peered at Sheod with a mixture of intrigue and amusement. "What's that mischievous look on your face, Sheod? What have you discovered during your watch?"</p>
<p>Sheod's eyes sparkled with excitement as he shared his newfound ability. "My friends, during my watch, a wondrous gift befell me. I can now understand and speak with the creatures of the forest, the very animals that inhabit our surroundings. The world has come alive with their voices, their stories, and their wisdom."</p>
<p>Vaxidd raised an eyebrow, his interest piqued. "Truly? This is a remarkable talent, Sheod. Imagine the knowledge we can glean from these creatures, the insights they can offer."</p>
<p>Sheod nodded, his voice filled with enthusiasm. "Indeed, Vaxidd. It is a gift that brings us closer to the heartbeat of nature, allowing us to forge deeper connections and unravel the secrets of the wilderness."</p>
<p>Mortimer, the ever-curious spellcaster, grinned ear to ear. "I can only imagine the tales they have to share, the perspectives they offer. This opens up a world of possibilities for our journey."</p>
<p>And so, as the adventurers gathered in a circle, their spirits ignited by Sheod's revelation, they marveled at the magic that surrounded them. The morning sun bathed the camp in a warm glow, illuminating their faces with a sense of renewed purpose and unity.</p>
<p>With hearts brimming with anticipation, they set forth into the new day, eager to reach Conyberry and Agatha, in the search of the spell book.</p>
<h1 id="day-5">Day 5</h1>
<h2 id="an-unusual-encounter">An unusual encounter</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/05-swamp-snakes.webp" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/05-swamp-snakes.webp" /></a></p>
<p>As the morning sun cast its golden rays upon the adventurers' path towards Conyberry, a distressing cry pierced through the tranquil ambiance of the forest. The sound, a desperate plea for help, tugged at their hearts and beckoned their attention.</p>
<p>Sheod, his newfound ability to communicate with animals still fresh in his mind, turned his head, his ears attuned to the cries. His eyes widened with recognition as he deciphered the distress call—an anguished squirrel in need of assistance. Without a moment's hesitation, he broke away from the group, determined to investigate and offer aid.</p>
<p>Pushing through the thick underbrush of the swampy forest, Sheod's heart pounded with a mix of apprehension and curiosity. And then, amidst the tangled foliage, he beheld a sight that defied all logic and reason—a squirrel, not of its usual diminutive size, but towering as tall as a human. Its plump cheeks were filled to the brim, a testament to its foraging efforts.</p>
<p>Yet, the surreal scene quickly turned dire as Sheod's eyes followed the desperate creature's gaze. A colossal snake, its scaled body coiled and ready to strike, loomed nearby. The creature's size was a spectacle in itself, stretching to a staggering two meters in length, its girth rivaling that of a mighty tree trunk.</p>
<p>Sheod's instincts kicked into overdrive as adrenaline surged through his veins. He swiftly notched an arrow onto his bowstring, taking aim with the precision of a practiced archer. With a steady hand, he released the projectile, the arrow finding its mark with unerring accuracy, striking the snake's scaly hide.</p>
<p>A cry for aid erupted from Sheod's lips, his voice carrying a mix of urgency and determination. "Help! I've found a massive snake attacking an unusually large squirrel! We must act swiftly!"</p>
<p>Mortimer, Vaxidd, and Orianna, startled by Sheod's urgent plea, snapped into action. 
Mortimer quipped “Ah, Sheod, the protector of the fluffy-tailed kingdom. I can see it now, a squirrel monarchy with acorn crowns and tree stump thrones. All hail King Sheod, ruler of the Nutlands!”</p>
<p>With a surge of purpose, the trio raced through the swampy terrain, their footsteps splashing through muddy puddles. Vaxidd, his righteous fury ignited, clutched his warhammer tightly, prepared to face the monstrous snake head-on. Orianna, her agile form moving with grace, unsheathed her lute, ready to lend her dexterous skills to the fray.</p>
<p>As they arrived on the scene, their eyes widened in astonishment at the bizarre tableau before them. The squirrel, though frightened, held its ground with surprising courage, its eyes pleading for salvation. The snake, wounded but still dangerous, hissed with venomous intent.</p>
<p>With adrenaline coursing through his veins, Vaxidd unleashed a battle cry, his warhammer cleaving through the air with a mighty swing. It connected with a satisfying thud, shaking the very ground beneath them. "Take that, you scaly menace!" he exclaimed, a victorious grin spreading across his face.</p>
<p>Orianna, her lute humming with arcane power, stepped forward with a mischievous glint in her eyes. Her fingers danced along the strings, weaving a spell of cutting words. With each word she sang, the air seemed to thicken with a subtle enchantment, the very essence of her insults striking at the snake's confidence and competence.</p>
<p>As the battle unfolded, Mortimer, ever the resourceful spellcaster, reached into his robe's inner pocket. From within emerged a furry white ball, transforming before their eyes into a majestic owl. He whispered ancient incantations, infusing the owl with potent arcane energy. The owl soared gracefully above the giant snakes, its wings trailing trails of mystical light. With a sudden burst, it unleashed a torrent of crackling lightning, searing and electrocuting the serpentine foes.</p>
<p>The startled squirrel took advantage of the distraction, darting away from the snakes with a renewed sense of freedom. However, the snakes, undeterred, pursued their prey onto dry land, slithering relentlessly in their pursuit. Vaxidd, his determination unwavering, brought his warhammer crashing down upon one of the snakes, its scales yielding to the forceful blow. Sheod, an arrow poised in his bow, released it with unerring accuracy, piercing the flesh of another snake.</p>
<p>Mortimer, emboldened by his newfound prowess, held his hand aloft, a small indicator glowing with arcane energy. With a resolute shout, he unleashed a fiery projectile, a scorching orb hurtling toward the remaining snake. The projectile erupted in a brilliant display of flames, enveloping the serpent in a fiery embrace.</p>
<p>As the defeated snakes writhed and succumbed to their wounds, the adventurers stood triumphant amidst the aftermath of their fierce battle. Panting heavily, they exchanged glances of pride and relief, a camaraderie forged through shared danger.</p>
<p>"Well, I'd say we made quite the team, wouldn't you?" Vaxidd chuckled, wiping sweat from his brow.
Orianna smirked, her lute still humming with residual magic. "Indeed, our insults were truly cutting this time."
Mortimer grinned, his owl familiar perched on his shoulder. "Looks like I've found my groove. Fiery projectiles seem to be my calling."
Sheod, his bow in hand, nodded appreciatively. "We fought well together. And I must admit, Mortimer, your newfound affinity for owl-induced lightning was quite impressive."</p>
<p>As the group cautiously approached the distressed squirrel, they observed its seemingly harmless appearance, its cheeks engorged with something peculiar. With a sudden burst, the squirrel expelled two lifeless bodies, revealing them to be elves clad in vibrant circus attire. The adventurers recognized them instantly as members of the famed Jumping Wood Elves, a troupe known for their acrobatic feats and daring performances.</p>
<p>A mix of shock and sorrow washed over the party as they inspected the lifeless forms of the fallen elves. The realization of their tragic fate weighed heavy upon their hearts. The elves' colorful costumes, now stained with dirt and blood, told a tale of a wandering circus act disrupted by unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Vaxidd's voice broke the silence, his tone somber yet resolute. "These performers deserved a proper farewell. Let us build a pyre and give them a respectful send-off." The others nodded in agreement, recognizing the importance of honoring the fallen.</p>
<p>With a collective effort, the adventurers gathered wood and constructed a pyre in a suitable clearing nearby. They carefully laid the bodies of the two wood elves upon it, their limbs arranged with care and reverence. Mortimer, his voice tinged with sadness, uttered words of farewell and remembrance, his magical incantations lending an ethereal quality to the air.</p>
<p>As the flames began to consume the pyre, casting a warm glow upon the surrounding area, the group stood in solemn silence, paying their respects to the departed souls. Their promise to return the money they had discovered among the elves' possessions echoed in their minds, a testament to their integrity and the bond they shared.</p>
<p>Orianna's gaze lingered upon the cloaks of billowing, a glimmer of curiosity dancing in her eyes. "These cloaks hold an enchanting charm," she remarked, her voice filled with intrigue. "While wearing them, we can command them to billow dramatically, adding a touch of flair to our presence."</p>
<p>Vaxidd's lips curled into a bittersweet smile. "Perhaps, in their memory, we can carry a piece of their performance with us," he suggested. "Let these cloaks serve as a reminder of the joy and artistry they brought to the world."</p>
<p>With the pyre now reduced to flickering embers, the adventurers took a moment to collect themselves, their thoughts turning to the ongoing journey that lay before them. They carefully gathered the sack of golden coins, a small token of remembrance for the fallen elves, and vowed to return the wealth if they were to encounter any surviving relatives in their travels.</p>
<p>Bound by a shared commitment to honor and camaraderie, the group resumed their path, the cloaks of billowing adorning their shoulders and the memory of the Jumping Wood Elves forever imprinted in their hearts. With every billow of their cloaks, they would carry the spirit of the fallen performers, a testament to the indomitable nature of the human spirit and the power of unity in the face of adversity.</p>
<h2 id="attacked-by-skeletons-during-the-night">Attacked by skeletons during the night</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/05-skeleton-army.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/05-skeleton-army.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>As the night settled in and the weary adventurers prepared to rest, Vaxidd, Mortimer, and Orianna took their positions for the first watch. Sheod, with his elven nature and unique meditation practice, found solace atop a nearby tree, ever vigilant and ready for any danger that might arise.</p>
<p>In the stillness of the night, a cacophony of sounds reached Sheod's keen ears. The rhythmic marching of feet blended with the bone-chilling clatter of skeletal creatures, unsettling the tranquility of the surroundings. He quickly scanned the area, alerting his companions to the approaching threat.</p>
<p>Mortimer, jolted from his drowsiness, snapped into action. His mind raced with possibilities as he summoned his arcane abilities. With a flick of his wrist, he conjured an illusion of a towering and enraged barbarian, the illusionary figure brandishing a menacing log. Through the power of his telekinesis, the log appeared to be wielded with lethal force, giving the illusion life.</p>
<p>The sound of marching ceased, momentarily halted by the sight of the intimidating illusion. Arrows whistled through the air, finding their mark in the illusion's form. Mortimer's illusory creation absorbed the projectiles, mimicking the impact of real arrows striking a flesh-and-blood adventurer.</p>
<p>Sensing the opportunity, Vaxidd charged forward with unyielding resolve. Sheod and Orianna moved with calculated precision, flanking their paladin companion. Their weapons sliced through the air, clashing against the skeletal foes with a resounding clash. The clash of steel against bone echoed through the night as they engaged in a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Mortimer's attention turned to his loyal familiar, an owl perched nearby. With a touch and a whispered incantation, he bestowed upon the owl the power to unleash a cone of magical fire. The familiar took flight, soaring above the battleground. With a graceful sweep of its wings, the owl unleashed a blazing inferno upon the approaching skeletal horde, reducing their brittle forms to charred remnants.</p>
<p>The skirmish unfolded with a dance of steel and magic. Vaxidd's hammer found its mark, pulverizing the skeletal adversaries with each mighty swing. Sheod's arrows whistled through the air, striking the weak points of their bony frames. Orianna's bardic magic resonated, empowering her allies and striking fear into the hearts of their foes.</p>
<p>The battle was fierce, but the adventurers fought with unwavering determination. The skeletons, once a formidable force, were reduced to shattered bones and smoldering ashes. Their numbers dwindled with each well-placed strike and devastating spell.</p>
<p>As the final skeleton crumbled to the ground, silence settled over the battleground. The adventurers stood amidst the remnants of their fallen enemies, their breaths ragged and hearts pounding with the adrenaline of victory. The night air whispered their triumph, carrying the echoes of their valiant efforts.</p>
<p>With a mixture of relief and satisfaction, the group regrouped, taking a moment to catch their breath and assess the aftermath of the skirmish. The bones lay strewn across the forest floor, a testament to their prowess and teamwork.</p>
<p>"We make quite the formidable team, don't we?" Mortimer quipped, a hint of pride in his voice.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, wiping the sweat from his brow, offered a smile of camaraderie. "Indeed, my friends. Our unity and skill have once again proven victorious."</p>
<p>Orianna nodded, her eyes gleaming with admiration for her companions. "Together, we can face any challenge that comes our way. The night may be dark, but our spirits shine bright."</p>
<p>The adventurers took a moment to bask in their hard-earned triumph, knowing that their journey would continue, fraught with both peril and glory. With renewed determination, they readied themselves for the road ahead, their bond forged stronger through the crucible of battle.</p>
<h2 id="a-decoy">A decoy</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/05-decoy.webp" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/05-decoy.webp" /></a></p>
<p>The distant sound of marching skeletons grew louder, a chilling reminder of the relentless pursuit behind them. Panic gripped the hearts of the adventurers as they realized the impending danger. With fear guiding their actions, they darted through the dense forest, their feet pounding against the earth with desperate urgency.</p>
<p>Sheod, ever quick-witted, had a spark of inspiration amidst the chaos. "I have an idea!" he shouted to his companions, a glimmer of determination in his eyes. "I'll serve as a decoy and draw them away. Mortimer, lend me a hand!"</p>
<p>Mortimer, his mind a whirlwind of arcane possibilities, unleashed his magical prowess once more. With a wave of his hand, a magnificent horse materialized before them, its form ethereal and radiant. The unexpected sight elicited a mix of surprise and admiration from the rest of the party, their trust in Mortimer's extraordinary abilities solidifying.</p>
<p>With a nod of agreement, the adventurers split into two groups, their destinies intertwined yet divergent. Mortimer, Orianna, and Vaxidd set off on the main road towards Conyberry, their steps resolute and their determination unyielding. Sheod, on the other hand, veered off in the direction of Phandalin, his plan to serve as a tantalizing lure for the encroaching skeletal horde.</p>
<p>Sheod's heart raced as he pushed his physical limits, his senses attuned to the approaching threat. Drawing nearer to the relentless march of skeletons, he skillfully weaved through the treacherous terrain, a dance of evasion and misdirection. His ranger instincts guided his every move, enabling him to outmaneuver his relentless pursuers, leading them astray from his comrades.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rest of the party, their hearts heavy with concern for Sheod's safety, raced forward, their feet pounding against the earth. They pushed through exhaustion, their determination fueled by the knowledge that their fates were intertwined. The outskirts of Conyberry beckoned like a beacon of respite, a temporary sanctuary amidst the encroaching darkness.</p>
<p>Finally reaching the relative safety of Conyberry's outskirts, Mortimer, Orianna, and Vaxidd paused to catch their breath. A mixture of relief and worry filled the air, their minds filled with thoughts of Sheod's perilous journey. They knew they must wait, giving Sheod the time needed to circle back and reunite with their band of adventurers.</p>
<p>As the sun set and rose once again, Sheod maneuvered with calculated precision, his senses attuned to the movements of the skeletal horde. With a deft display of skill and ingenuity, he steered the relentless pursuers in the wrong direction, exploiting their lack of sentience to his advantage. The shadows became his ally as he navigated through the undergrowth, each step bringing him closer to his comrades in Conyberry.</p>
<p>Finally, the long-awaited moment arrived. Sheod emerged from the forest, a triumphant smile upon his face. He had successfully eluded the skeletal horde, employing his ranger skills to navigate the perilous landscape. The weary adventurers greeted him with a mixture of relief and admiration, their bond strengthened by their collective triumph over adversity.</p>
<p>As the weary adventurers gathered in Conyberry, their exhaustion palpable, Mortimer couldn't help but interject with a lighthearted remark, aiming to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>"Phew! Sheod, I must say, you really know how to take a scenic detour," Mortimer chuckled, his eyes twinkling mischievously. "I mean, who needs a grand entrance when you can lead a parade of skeletons, right?"</p>
<p>Sheod let out a good-natured laugh, his fatigue momentarily forgotten. "Ah, you've got me there, Mortimer. I always aim for the unconventional approach, even when it comes to skeleton escorts. Keeps things interesting, don't you think?"</p>
<p>The rest of the party joined in the laughter, and the weight of their recent trials felt a little lighter. With renewed determination, the adventurers settled into a momentary respite, their spirits emboldened by their unwavering resolve. They knew that their paths would intersect once more, their destinies forever intertwined in the face of the challenges yet to come.</p>
<h2 id="arriving-at-conyberry">Arriving at Conyberry</h2>

<p>As the party steps into the eerie shelter formed by the twisted vines and ancient trees, a hushed silence envelops them. The air grows colder, and a faint flickering light dances in the shadows. A shiver runs down their spines as Agatha, the banshee, materializes before them, her ethereal form exuding an otherworldly presence.</p>
<p>"Foolish mortals," Agatha's voice echoes with a mixture of disdain and curiosity. "What brings you to this sacred place? Do you not know it is death to seek me out?"</p>
<p>Vaxidd, the charismatic paladin, steps forward, his voice steady and respectful. "Honored Agatha," he begins, holding out the silver comb bestowed upon them by Sister Garaele, "we come seeking guidance and knowledge. We bear a token of our respect and a symbol of our sincere intentions."</p>
<p>The banshee's piercing gaze softens for a moment as she examines the silver comb. A faint smile plays upon her spectral lips. "Very well," she concedes, her voice carrying an ancient wisdom. "You have shown yourselves to be worthy of my attention. Ask me one question, and I shall provide you with an answer."</p>
<p>Orianna, the inquisitive bard, steps forward, her eyes filled with curiosity. "Agatha, we seek the whereabouts of Bowgentle's spellbook. Can you reveal to us where it might be found?"</p>
<p>Agatha's ethereal figure leans closer, her eyes gleaming with an otherworldly wisdom. "Long ago, I traded the coveted tome to a necromancer named Tsernoth in the bustling city of Iriaebor," she divulges, her voice carrying the weight of forgotten years. "As for its fate thereafter, the knowledge eludes even me."</p>
<p>The adventurers absorb the information, their minds racing with thoughts and possibilities. Gratitude fills their hearts as they thank Agatha for her guidance. With a flicker of her pale form, she fades back into the ethereal plane, leaving them in the quiet shelter, the remnants of elven craftsmanship surrounding them.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the dome, the adventurers are greeted by the tranquility of Conyberry, the ruins of a once-thriving town. The forest seems to hold its breath, as if whispering ancient secrets to those who would listen. The air is heavy with a sense of mystery and lingering sorrow.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his eyes gleaming with renewed determination, turns to his companions. "We have obtained the knowledge we sought," he declares, his voice filled with resolve. "Now, let us continue our journey, for there are still more mysteries to uncover and challenges to face."</p>
<p>The party bids farewell to the desolate ruins of Conyberry, their footsteps echoing through the silence. With each step, their hearts grow lighter, buoyed by the guidance of Agatha and the knowledge she imparted. They venture forth, their path clearer than ever before, eager to uncover the remaining secrets that await them in the vast realm of adventure.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-phandalin">Back to Phandalin</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/05-zombies.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/05-zombies.png" /></a></p>
<p>As the sun begins its descent, casting an orange glow across the land, the adventurers make their way back to Phandalin. The familiar sight of the town on the horizon fills them with a sense of comfort and familiarity. However, their peaceful journey is abruptly interrupted by the sight of figures in the distance, stumbling and lurching with an unsettling gait. Zombies.</p>
<p>"By the gods!" Vaxidd exclaims, his eyes narrowing as he recognizes one of the undead figures. "Tharden... my cousin."</p>
<p>The party braces themselves for the battle ahead, their hearts heavy with the knowledge that they must face not only mindless abominations but also the remnants of their own kin. The clash is fierce, swords slashing through decaying flesh, and spells crackling with arcane energy.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos, Vaxidd finds himself locked in combat with the zombified form of Tharden. Memories of their childhood together, of shared laughter and dreams, flood Vaxidd's mind. His heart aches with grief, torn between the duty to protect and the desire to preserve the memory of his cousin.</p>
<p>In a moment of somber realization, Vaxidd makes his choice. With tears in his eyes, he raises his warhammer high, calling upon the divine power bestowed upon him by Moradin, the dwarven deity. With a heavy blow, Tharden's undead form crumbles to dust, the spirit within released from its torment.</p>
<p>The battle rages on, Mortimer conjuring the might of his familiar's dragon breath, a blaze of fiery destruction that engulfs the remaining zombies. The creatures, once threats, are reduced to smoldering remnants, scattered across the battlefield.</p>
<p>As the dust settles, the party gathers together, a shared grief uniting them. Words are spoken in hushed tones, comforting gestures offered in silent support. They understand the weight of the choices made in the heat of battle, and the pain that comes with them.</p>
<p>"Sometimes the greatest act of mercy is to release those we love from their suffering," Mortimer says softly, his voice carrying a mix of compassion and wisdom. "Tharden may have been lost to us, but his spirit is now at peace."</p>
<p>A moment of silence follows, the weight of loss hanging in the air. Then, Orianna, the ever-optimistic bard, breaks the tension with a touch of levity. "Well, I guess we can say family reunions aren't always what they're cracked up to be," she quips, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her lips.</p>
<p>The tension eases, and a brief chuckle escapes the lips of the party members. It is in these moments, amidst the trials and tribulations, that the bonds between them grow stronger, forged in shared experiences and the understanding that they are not alone on their journey.</p>
<p>With heavy hearts and renewed determination, the adventurers continue their path towards Phandalin, knowing that there are still challenges to face and mysteries to unravel. Together, they will forge their own destinies and find solace in the strength of their unity.</p>
<p>The sun had set, casting a warm orange glow on the horizon as the party returned to Phandalin, heavy with the weight of their recent battle. The figures in the distance, emerging from the shadows just outside the town, caught their attention. As they drew nearer, the flickering light revealed the unsettling truth: zombies. Grotesque forms, once familiar faces, now twisted and menacing.</p>
<p>Vaxidd's heart skipped a beat as he recognized one of the zombies among them – his cousin, Tharden Rockseeker. It was a sight that struck a painful chord deep within him, a reminder of the perils of their journey and the horrors that could befall even those they held dear. Tharden's vacant eyes met Vaxidd's, but the spark of recognition was long gone.</p>
<p>The battle that ensued was fierce, a chaotic dance of steel and magic against the undead. Orianna's lute hummed with an otherworldly melody, enhancing the power of her words as they cut through the air like blades. Mortimer's owl familiar, fueled by arcane energy, unleashed torrents of flame upon the encroaching zombies. Sheod's arrows found their marks, each shot a testament to his skill with the bow. And Vaxidd, the paladin, fought with a determination that seemed to channel his sorrow into every swing of his hammer.</p>
<p>The tide of battle turned, with the adventurers slowly gaining the upper hand as their teamwork and resolve held strong. As half of the zombies fell, the clash between Vaxidd and the zombified Tharden became the focal point of the fight. Every strike felt like a stab to Vaxidd's heart, a brutal reminder of the twisted fate that had befallen his cousin.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos, a moment of decision hung in the air. Vaxidd's grip on his warhammer tightened, his mind torn between avenging Tharden's fate and showing him mercy. In that moment, the divine connection he shared with Moradin, the god of his people, surged within him. With a heavy heart, he called upon that power, allowing divine energy to course through his weapon as he delivered a final blow.</p>
<p>Tharden's zombified form crumbled, his torment finally coming to an end. The battle drew to a close, the last of the zombies falling under the party's combined might. The air was thick with a solemn silence as they surveyed the aftermath of the fight.</p>
<p>Among the fallen, the party discovered clues that added a layer of mystery to the encounter. The bodies of the undead held unusual marks – arrows embedded in their flesh, but not the cause of their death. The diversity of the fallen was striking – two human redbrands, an Aracroka with a severed hand, and a Tabaxi with a vibrant red mohawk. It was a peculiar group, and the motives behind their transformation into zombies remained unclear.</p>
<p>With a shared determination, the party gathered the remains of the fallen, constructing a massive pyre. As the flames engulfed the bodies, a mix of emotions swirled within them – grief for those lost, uncertainty about the circumstances, and the unspoken camaraderie that had strengthened through their trials.</p>
<p>The crackling fire illuminated their faces, casting flickering shadows that danced upon their features. It was a moment of reflection, a reminder of the unpredictability of their journey, and a testament to their resilience in the face of darkness. The night was still, the echoes of their battle fading into the quiet of the town.</p>
<p>As the pyre burned down to embers, the party knew that their path was far from over. The mysteries surrounding the zombies and their unsettling origins demanded further exploration. But for now, they found solace in the unity forged through their shared experiences and the bond that had grown among them. And in that moment, amidst the remnants of the fire, they found a moment of respite, a chance to gather their strength before the next chapter of their adventure began.</p>
<h2 id="arriving-at-phandalin_1">Arriving at Phandalin</h2>
<p>As the party returned to Phandalin, the air felt heavy with a mixture of anticipation and sadness. News of a tragedy awaited them. The sheriff's son, the young boy they had saved alongside his mother, had met a grim fate. The very Nothic that they had left behind in the depths of the Redbrand hideout had claimed his life. The weight of the situation settled on their hearts, a stark reminder of the consequences their actions – or lack thereof – could bring.</p>
<p>The village, usually bustling with a peaceful atmosphere, now carried an air of tension. Adults walked with weapons at their sides, a stark contrast to the usual serene ambiance. A strange realization dawned on the adventurers – most of these weapons were the very ones they had retrieved from the Redbrands. Their efforts to rid the village of the ruffians had not only brought safety but had also armed the townsfolk.</p>
<p>Upon visiting the Local Merchant, gratitude radiated from her as she expressed her thanks for the adventurers' continuous efforts. Their heroic deeds had ignited a surge in business, with customers flocking to her shop to purchase the weapons and equipment the party had recovered. The store shelves, once barren, now gleamed with polished weapons and armor.</p>
<p>The news about the sheriff's son was somber. The young boy had ventured into the Redbrand hideout, driven by curiosity or perhaps a misguided sense of bravery, and paid the ultimate price. His loss cast a shadow over the village, a poignant reminder of the dangers that still lingered.</p>
<p>The Nothic's fate hung in the balance, and the village had decreed an execution at dawn. It was a decision met with mixed emotions, as the creature's presence had haunted the town for too long. While some viewed it as a necessary measure, others couldn't help but feel a tinge of sympathy for the tragic fate that had befallen the once-humanoid creature.</p>
<p>"As evening descended, the party sought refuge at the familiar inn owned by Orianna's father. The warmth of the hearth and the camaraderie of their companions offered a bittersweet comfort.</p>
<p>Vaxidd cleared his throat, the weight of their decision heavy on his shoulders. He gazed into the flickering flames, his eyes reflecting the dancing firelight. "We've got news," he began somberly, "and it's not good."</p>
<p>Orianna's father, a stout and welcoming figure, looked up from polishing a glass behind the bar. Concern etched lines on his face as he set aside the glass. "What's troubling you, lad?" His voice carried the wisdom of one who had seen his share of sorrows.</p>
<p>Sister Garaele, her eyes filled with an unspoken understanding, turned her attention toward the group, her brow furrowing in anticipation. Her presence seemed to lend an air of solemnity to the room.</p>
<p>Sheod, his expression etched with pensive lines, took a deep breath before continuing, his words weighed with regret. "We need to confess something. When we encountered the Nothic in the Redbrand hideout, we made a choice—a choice to spare it. We believed it posed no immediate threat, but now..." He let his words hang in the air, heavy and regretful.</p>
<p>Orianna's father exchanged a knowing glance with Sister Garaele, both of them acutely aware of the gravity of the situation. The decision they had entrusted to these adventurers had borne unforeseen consequences, and the burden now rested on their shoulders.</p>
<p>"Tell us," Sister Garaele urged, her voice gentle yet insistent, a voice that had consoled many in times of sorrow.</p>
<p>Mortimer, his usually confident demeanor shaken, continued, his gaze fixed on the worn wooden floor. "The sheriff's son ventured into the hideout alone, and the Nothic... it took his life." His words held a weight that seemed to hang in the air like a heavy shroud.</p>
<p>A profound silence followed, each member of the group lost in their thoughts. Orianna's father sighed deeply, the sorrow of the tragedy touching his eyes. "That poor boy," he murmured, the words carrying the weight of empathy.</p>
<p>Vaxidd's voice quivered with sorrow as he added, "We had a choice, and we made it. We thought we were doing what was right at the time."</p>
<p>Sister Garaele nodded, her expression a mix of understanding and disappointment in the imperfection of human judgment. "Actions have consequences, and sometimes, we must bear the burden of our decisions."</p>
<p>The group shared a heavy silence, their remorse palpable in the dimly lit inn. The hearth crackled with the warmth of the fire, a stark contrast to the heaviness that now hung in the room."</p>
<p>"As painful as it is, it's a lesson we must all carry with us," Sister Garaele finally said, her gaze meeting each of theirs in turn. "You have done much good for this village, but remember that even heroes aren't infallible. It's the very act of making choices, of having the courage to act, that defines us. Unfortunately, the world we navigate is fraught with uncertainty, and all we can do is hope our judgments are sound."</p>
<p>Orianna, strumming a solemn chord on her lute, softly added, "And if our judgments are not sound, then we must face the consequences and learn from them. That's the only way we can truly honor the fallen."</p>
<p>Her father offered a weary but grateful smile. "This town would be in a much worse state if it weren't for you all. Remember that, and let it guide you through the trials that still await. You've lost today, but don't lose yourselves in regret. Instead, carry that regret as a reminder to do better, to be better."</p>
<p>Mortimer nodded, his owl familiar, perched silently on his shoulder, almost as if sharing in the collective mood. "It's a painful lesson but one we won't forget. We have a responsibility to make things right, starting with the Nothic. Its fate has been decided, and we'll be there at dawn to see it through. And as for the town, we'll continue to protect it, with even greater resolve."</p>
<p>"We have already learned that facing a challenge is not just about defeating it," Sheod added. "It's about understanding it, considering the consequences, and taking responsible action. We'll carry that understanding forward, whatever comes our way."</p>
<p>"Let's raise a glass," Vaxidd said, his tone tinged with solemnity as he lifted his mug. "To those we've lost, to the lessons we've learned, and to a future where we make amends."</p>
<p>Glasses clinked softly in the dim light, the sound a quiet but firm pact among them. Though the atmosphere was laden with sorrow and regret, it also hummed with a renewed sense of purpose and unity.</p>
<p>As they finished their drinks and prepared for the night, each was alone with their thoughts yet united in resolve. Tomorrow would bring a new day, one fraught with its own dangers and moral complexities. But for now, in this moment of quiet reflection, they drew strength from their collective will to face those challenges head-on, to make amends, and to strive to be the heroes that Phandalin—and themselves—needed them to be.# Day 6</p>
<h2 id="morning-of-remorse">Morning of Remorse</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/06-phandalin.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/06-phandalin.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>The morning sun brought no warmth for the adventurers as they found themselves outside the home of the grieving mother. Taking a collective breath, they entered the humble dwelling.</p>
<p>Inside, the mother sat, her eyes red from tears, yet vacant—as if the tears had long since drained her of emotion. The room was thick with an unspeakable grief.</p>
<p>"We've come to tell you what happened," Vaxidd began, his voice quivering despite his attempt at stoicism. "We wish to share the truth with you, in the hope that transparency may offer some small solace, though it cannot bring back your son."</p>
<p>Each member of the party took turns explaining their encounter with the Nothic, the decision they made to spare its life, and their deep regret that this choice had contributed to her son's death. Mortimer's eyes were particularly moist as he concluded, "We are so profoundly sorry. Our actions—or lack thereof—cost you dearly, and we bear the weight of that."</p>
<p>The mother stared at them, her gaze piercing but unfocused. "You come to my home with words," she said flatly, her voice tinged with bitterness. "Words do not bring back the dead."</p>
<p>"We understand that we can't undo what has happened," Orianna added gently, her voice carrying a sorrowful melody. "We wish we could, but we can't. All we can do now is to make sure it never happens again."</p>
<p>"You think that comforts me?" The mother's voice wavered between grief and anger. "Leave my home."</p>
<p>The adventurers retreated, their spirits broken, yet understanding the magnitude of her loss. Each step away from her door felt like a weight added to their already burdened hearts.</p>
<h2 id="the-burning-pyre">The Burning Pyre</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/06-pyre.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/06-pyre.png" /></a></p>
<p>The town square was unusually quiet for what was to be a public execution. A large pyre was erected at the center, and upon it, the Nothic was bound and blindfolded. Its raspy voice broke the silence, "Was promised food! Not this! Was promised!"</p>
<p>The crowd's emotions were mixed. There were those who wanted the Nothic dead, a necessary end to the threat it posed. Others whispered amongst themselves, uncomfortable with the idea of executing a creature that was as much a victim of dark magic as the people it had endangered.</p>
<p>As the adventurers stepped into the square, the weight of the impending execution filled the air, made heavier still by the Nothic's insistent cries. Vaxidd locked eyes with the creature for a moment, its blindfolded gaze filled with confusion and fear.</p>
<p>"We had a choice back then, and we've got another choice now," Vaxidd muttered to his companions.</p>
<p>Orianna looked at the bound Nothic, then back at her friends. "What are we going to do?"</p>
<p>Mortimer, still nursing the pain from their recent visit, said, "We can't undo our past mistakes, but we can make a decision now that might bring about some form of justice, or at least understanding."</p>
<p>The Nothic, seemingly sensing their deliberation, continued to plead. "Didn't kill the youngling! Was promised food! Not my fault!"</p>
<p>Sheod pulled an arrow from his quiver and stared at it contemplatively. "Are we going to intervene? And if we do, what then? What place do we have in deciding its fate?"</p>
<p>The crowd became restless, the time for the pyre to be lit was near. The adventurers exchanged glances, each one's face etched with the weight of the decision before them. And in that heavy silence, they knew that the choice they made would echo in the lives of everyone involved, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Mortimer took a deep, steadying breath as he stepped forward, gripping his staff tightly in his hands. He struck the staff on the cobblestones with a force that emanated a thunderous sound, filling the air with its rumbling resonance.</p>
<p>"SILENCE!" he bellowed, his voice carrying across the square and hushing the murmurs.</p>
<p>Heads turned, eyes met his, and in that moment, the crowd gave him their undivided attention.</p>
<p>"We owe you the truth," Mortimer began, his voice quivering but determined. "We, the so-called champions of this town, are responsible for the tragedy that has befallen us. We left the Nothic alive, believing it was not an immediate threat, believing that perhaps it could change. Our judgment was flawed. The young boy—may his soul rest—paid the price for our foolishness. We stand before you, not as heroes, but as people who erred gravely. I ask you all...can you ever forgive us?"</p>
<p>His words hung in the air like a thick fog, and as he spoke, the faces in the crowd showed a range of emotions—from understanding to resentment, from pity to pure rage.</p>
<p>Before anyone could respond, a ruckus erupted from the pyre. The Nothic had managed to wriggle enough to shake off its blindfold. Its single eye glinted menacingly as it looked around. With a terrifying screech, it unleashed a burst of psychic energy, disintegrating a villager in the front row. Screams filled the air, the crowd scattering in panic.</p>
<p>In that moment, regret and hesitation vanished from Mortimer's being. He extended his staff toward the creature and chanted an incantation. A bolt of fire sprang from the staff, igniting the pyre instantly.</p>
<p>At the same moment, Sheod nocked an arrow, his aim true despite the chaotic scene. The arrow flew through the air, striking the Nothic's eye. Blinded and pained, the creature let out a bone-chilling scream, its words still lamenting its fate. "Was promised food! Not fai—"</p>
<p>The flames consumed the Nothic, cutting off its words and its life. Its screams faded into the crackling of the burning wood, its form reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos, as the Nothic's screams died down and the crowd erupted into arguments, Mortimer felt himself being bumped. His attention had been firmly on the Nothic and the fire, but now he turned to see what had jostled him.</p>
<p>There, atop one of the nearby buildings, stood the enigmatic Drow Nezz. Her violet eyes gleamed with a mischievous spark as she effortlessly manipulated the three vials he had carried: mercury, dragon bile, and powdered nightshade. With an incantation, she mixed them, creating an eerie, iridescent concoction.</p>
<p>Before anyone could react, Nezz threw the vial towards the ground with practiced precision. The moment the glass shattered, an explosion of magical energy rippled through the square. From the remnants of the vial, a gruesome entity emerged—the Dragonblood Ooze.</p>
<p>The congealed blood of a dragon, imbued with dark magic, had taken form. However, its attempts to shape itself into a draconic form were twisted and unstable. It quivered and trembled, constantly shifting, as if attempting to don the guise of a dragon but failing miserably.</p>
<p>In a bizarre display of its confusion, the ooze attempted to manifest a breath weapon, but instead, it spewed forth a part of its own body, which it quickly reeled back in with a disgusted squelch.</p>
<p>The party, still reeling from the events surrounding the Nothic, now found themselves facing this bizarre monstrosity.</p>
<p>"Weirdest. Monster. Ever!" Orianna exclaimed between musical flourishes.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, resolute in his role as protector, couldn't help but chuckle as he blocked a particularly erratic lunge from the ooze. "At least it's as confused as we are!"</p>
<p>Sheod, with a smirk, quipped, "This thing should audition for a shape-shifting contest!"</p>
<p>Mortimer, despite his prior moral turmoil, flung firebolts towards the shifting target. With a determined grimace, he also cast an enchantment upon his owl familiar. Now, the owl was capable of shooting lightning bolts from its beak. A mischievous grin crept onto Mortimer's face as he muttered to himself, "Take that, you quivering mess!"</p>
<p>Sheod, a hint of disbelief in his eyes, drew his bow and fired arrows at the ever-shifting form of the ooze. "I thought we've seen it all," he muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, with his unwavering determination, positioned himself in front of his friends, shield raised high. "Stay behind me! I'll keep it at bay!" Orianna, the bard with a talent for magic, unleashed a flurry of musical notes that reverberated through the air, empowering her allies and resonating with the chaos of the ooze.</p>
<p>Mortimer, his owl familiar now an instrument of lightning, couldn't resist a final taunt. "Time to zap some sense into it!"</p>
<p>Vaxidd's shield clashed with the amorphous body of the Dragonblood Ooze, causing ripples to traverse its jelly-like surface. The creature tried to shape itself into something resembling a dragon's maw, attempting to chomp down on Vaxidd. However, the magical shield seemed to sizzle upon contact, forcing the ooze to recoil.</p>
<p>"Incorporate this, you slithering pile of goo!" Vaxidd roared, driving his hammer into the creature. As if struck by the force of his conviction, the ooze shivered, splattering globs of itself away from its core.</p>
<p>From a distance, Mortimer channeled another firebolt through his staff. The spell hurtled through the air with an infernal hiss, colliding with the ooze and turning part of its body into a splash of evaporating liquid. His owl familiar, empowered by the earlier enchantment, took to the skies. With a majestic beat of its wings, it ascended above the chaotic battlefield before swooping down like a bolt of feathery lightning. A crackling discharge emanated from its beak, jolting the ooze.</p>
<p>"This is a real hoot, isn't it?" Mortimer chuckled, his eyes gleaming with the flash of the spell.</p>
<p>Sheod, aiming carefully, loosed an arrow enshrouded in a glimmering magical aura. It pierced the ooze and emerged from the other side, leaving a tunnel-like void in its wake. "Pin the tail on the ooze!" Sheod announced, grinning from ear to ear. His eyes flicked to Orianna, who was strumming her lute with a frantic energy.</p>
<p>Each note that poured from Orianna's lute seemed to strike the ooze like a physical blow, vibrating its form as if disrupting its very essence. A crescendo built, each chord amplifying the attacks of her companions.</p>
<p>"And now for the finale," she said, striking a powerful chord that unleashed a visible wave of force, causing the ooze to quiver uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Seizing the moment, Mortimer, Vaxidd, and Sheod combined their attacks. Firebolts, arrows, and hammer strikes converged on the ooze in a coordinated flurry. The creature let out a noise—half growl, half screech—as it lost its form entirely, splattering onto the ground as nothing more than a lifeless puddle.</p>
<p>Just then, a shadow darted across the rooftops. It was Nezz, the elusive Drow. With no time to lose, Vaxidd sprinted ahead, his eyes locked onto his elusive target. Just as he was about to leap and tackle her, Nezz turned and murmured an incantation. A wave of magical energy enveloped Vaxidd. "Why don't you take a rest, you look so tired?" quipped Nezz. His eyes glazed over, and he sat down, as if in a trance, his hammer slipping from his grasp. "Yes... so tired, I'll rest for a bit"</p>
<p>"Vaxidd!" Sheod shouted, releasing an arrow in a fluid motion. The missile found its mark, embedding itself in Nezz's calf. She staggered but remained upright, cursing under her breath.</p>
<p>Mortimer, seizing the moment, stretched out his hand and chanted an incantation. The earth beneath Nezz quivered, then disappeared, leaving a gaping pit. With a cry of surprise and anger, she plummeted into the hole.</p>
<p>Both Sheod and Mortimer reached the pit's edge, peering down to see Nezz scowling up at them. Their hearts were pounding, not only from the battle but from the realization that they had just engaged with a foe who was likely far more dangerous than any they had faced before.</p>
<p>Orianna approached the pit's edge, lute in hand, and looked down at Nezz who was still scowling despite her precarious situation. "How about we lighten the mood?" she mused, strumming a unique set of chords on her lute. As she played, the air seemed to fill with an ethereal echo, forming an almost tangible aura of levity.</p>
<p>"In a cavern full of goblins," she began, her voice magically amplifying the punchline, "why did the goblin chef get kicked out? Because his food was always a little too 'stew-pid'!"</p>
<p>The magical reverberations of the joke intertwined with the melody, descending into the pit like a warm breeze. Nezz's expression contorted, fighting against the magical compulsion, but then broke into an involuntary, raucous laughter. Her laugh was so loud and forceful it was almost maniacal, echoing off the walls of the pit.</p>
<p>Seizing the opportunity, Sheod nimbly climbed down into the pit with a length of rope. He skillfully looped it around the still-laughing Nezz, his hands working quickly to form ranger knots—complex and nearly unbreakable.</p>
<p>Once satisfied with his handiwork, he climbed back out, and with Vaxidd now recovering from the charm, they pulled Nezz out of the pit and set her down. Her laughter subsided, but the knot held strong.</p>
<p>"Now," Mortimer started, pointing his staff at her, "you will tell us what you're doing here, the location of Cragmaw Castle, and why you've taken an interest in our affairs."</p>
<p>Nezz smirked. "Why would I tell you anything? You're the fools who let a monster kill a child. What makes you think you can handle what lies ahead?"</p>
<p>"We can handle more than you think," Vaxidd retorted, still a bit shaken from her charm spell. "But the question is, can you handle us?". Sheod tightened his grip on his bow. "Speak, or the next arrow might not be aimed at your leg."</p>
<p>For a moment, it looked like Nezz might actually comply, but just then, her hand wiggled free enough to grab a ruby pendant around her neck. Before anyone could react, she muttered a quick incantation. In an instant, her form turned blurry, as if she were made of mist, and then she vanished.</p>
<p>They stood there, their eyes meeting in disbelief and frustration. Nezz was gone, but the air was thick with the implication of her presence and the unanswered questions she left behind. The tension in their group was palpable—each of them knew that whatever lay ahead in their quest, the stakes had just gotten much higher.</p>
<h2 id="the-dust-settles">The dust settles</h2>
<p>The sun dipped beneath the horizon as the villagers worked side by side with the champions to clear away the smoldering remnants of the pyre and the ooze's acidic puddles. The atmosphere was still thick with tension, but the appreciation for their heroic efforts was unmistakable. Grateful nods and subdued thank-yous filled the air, their emotional weight just as meaningful as any effusive praise.</p>
<p>Feeling the ache in their bones and the toll of their moral and physical trials, the champions finally retired to Orianna's Inn. As they stepped into the warm glow of the hearth, each sank into a chair with palpable relief. A round of ale arrived courtesy of a grateful barmaid, foamy heads overflowing in their mugs.</p>
<p>"So, what now?" Sheod asked, setting down his mug and looking at the others. "That Drow is still out there, and we know she's connected to Cragmaw Castle and this 'Spider' character."</p>
<p>Orianna strummed her lute softly. "We must go to the castle. I don't know what awaits us there, but I sense that the threads of this wicked web originate from that place."</p>
<p>Vaxidd nodded, his jaw set firmly. "Agreed. But we need information, a plan. We can't just waltz into enemy territory unprepared."</p>
<p>Mortimer pondered, staring into the flames of the hearth. "Perhaps we should seek out those goblins we encountered earlier. We let them go in exchange for information, and they owe us. Maybe they can provide more insight into the castle's location."</p>
<p>The idea met with unanimous approval. Exhausted but resolute, they each retired to their rooms to prepare for the next leg of their journey.# Day 7</p>
<h2 id="old-friends">Old "friends"</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/07-goblins.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/07-goblins.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>The following morning, the champions found themselves once again in the forest where they had first encountered the goblins. Underbrush crunched beneath their boots, birdsong filled the air, and sunlight broke through the canopy in dappled patterns. Yet, a sense of foreboding loomed over them, as if the woods themselves were wary of their quest.</p>
<p>The champions set out from Phandalin, armor glistening in the dappled sunlight that filtered through the trees. Orianna's lute was safely slung over her back, and the enchantments on Mortimer's staff hummed quietly as they trudged through the forest. Their mission was as clear as the mid-morning sky: find Bob the Goblin, in hopes he might help guide them to Cragmaw Castle.</p>
<p>Just as the champions neared the place they had been first ambushed weeks prior, they heard rustling in the bushes followed by an abrupt "Psst!" Out popped Bob the Goblin, brandishing a small stick as if it were a mighty weapon.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's you again!" he exclaimed, pointing the stick at Orianna. "You're that devil who told us to be friendly!"</p>
<p>Orianna chuckled, strumming a light note on her lute. "Indeed, and it seems you've taken my advice to heart. What's with the stick?"</p>
<p>Bob grinned, lowering his makeshift weapon. "This is friendly raiding stick. No sharp, no hurt, just bonk!"</p>
<p>Mortimer smirked. "Friendly raiding, you say? Well, that's a novel approach."</p>
<p>Bob scratched his head, appearing slightly confused yet eager to please. "Um, yes! We bonk travelers, then ask for, um, 'donation.' All friendly-like!"</p>
<p>Vaxidd leaned on his mighty shield and sighed. "Oh, the creativity of goblins never ceases to amaze me. But we aren't here for a 'friendly raid.' We seek information."</p>
<p>Bob's eyes narrowed cautiously. "What kind?"</p>
<p>"We need to find Cragmaw Castle," Orianna said gently. "Do you know the way?"</p>
<p>Bob hesitated, his eyes darting from one champion to the next. Finally, he sighed. "Fine, you were good to Bob and his mates. I show you, but be careful. Castle dangerous place."</p>
<p>Sheod, who had been silently nocking an arrow in case things went south, eased the bowstring and nodded. "Lead the way, then."</p>
<p>Bob turned and scurried through the forest, leading the champions over uneven terrain and through snaking vines. Their footsteps were hushed whispers against the forest floor, as if even the Earth itself sensed the gravity of their mission. Finally, they came upon a hill that offered a panoramic view of the forest. Bob pointed a trembling finger towards a distant, crumbling tower peeking above the treeline.</p>
<p>"Cragmaw Castle there," he whispered, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "You go, you careful. You no die, you tell Bob. Bob want know."</p>
<p>Orianna strummed a series of chords on her lute, producing a melody that seemed to fill the air with a sense of resolve and determination. "We'll do our best, Bob. And we'll come back to tell the tale."</p>
<p>Bob grinned, seemingly relieved. "Good. Bob wait."</p>
<p>And with that, the goblin disappeared into the foliage as abruptly as he had arrived. The champions exchanged glances. The next stage of their journey was set, and as they looked toward the distant ruin that was Cragmaw Castle, each felt a mingling of anticipation and dread. But whatever awaited them—danger, traps, or answers—it was a path they would walk together.</p>
<p>As the champions stood poised to move toward Cragmaw Castle, Bob the Goblin hesitated. A thoughtful, or as thoughtful as a goblin can look, expression crept onto his face. "Wait, wait! Before castle, I show you something else. A special place we found. Very powerful!"</p>
<p>"Special place?" Mortimer raised an eyebrow, his hand instinctively caressing the runes on his staff. "What exactly are you talking about, Bob?"</p>
<p>Bob's eyes darted around nervously, as if contemplating the wisdom of his decision. "Come, come! You see."</p>
<p>He led them deeper into the forest, the foliage growing denser with each step. The sunlight waned, replaced by an eerie glow filtering through the thick canopy of leaves. After about half an hour, they reached a secluded cave mouth, shrouded in darkness and enshrouded by towering ferns.</p>
<p>"Here," Bob said, pointing into the cavern. "Go look. You find good thing."</p>
<p>Mortimer lit the tip of his staff, illuminating the cave in an azure glow. As they stepped inside, their eyes fell upon an astonishing sight: A statue of a devil goddess, carved with an artistry that seemed far beyond the abilities of any goblin. She was depicted in a seductive pose, wings unfurled, and her eyes seemed to glint with malevolent intelligence.</p>
<p>"We call her 'Orianna's Mother'," Bob giggled, clearly misunderstanding the form of the deity.</p>
<p>Vaxidd stiffened, his warrior senses instantly repulsed by the dark energy emanating from the statue. "This is no place for us," he murmured, his voice tinged with distrust.</p>
<p>Mortimer, a well-studied mage with a penchant for the arcane, frowned as he examined the statue. "This appears to be Ashara, a lesser-known devil goddess from the lore of the Forgotten Realms. She offers power at a dangerous cost, tempting mortals into her dark covenant."</p>
<p>Orianna, who had been quiet thus far, strummed her lute softly. The strings vibrated in tune with the dark energy, and her eyes met those of the devil goddess. For a fleeting moment, it seemed as though the statue winked at her. The room felt thick with palpable magic, and the air buzzed with energy, as if the very molecules were bending to some unfathomable will.</p>
<p>Orianna felt an internal pull, a beckoning that tugged at her very essence. She felt a voice whisper promises of unfathomable power, of songs that could control minds and melodies that could shape reality. The temptation was incredible.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, attuned to the earth and faithful to Moradin, could sense the imbalance of the situation. "We should not be meddling with this, Orianna. The cost may be too great."</p>
<p>Sheod, arrow still nocked but relaxed, eyed the statue. "I don't need any gifts from something that requires a cavern as its home. Pass."</p>
<p>But Orianna, her fingers gently caressing her lute, made her decision. She nodded once, as if confirming a pact with the stone deity. The air seemed to crackle, the latent energy focusing into her being, infusing her with newfound strength. She could feel her songs and spells becoming more potent, more nuanced. She now had the power to manipulate more beings, to shift the balance of a room, a town, perhaps even the world.</p>
<p>Mortimer shook his head, muttering ancient proverbs under his breath about the dangers of meddling with gods, but Orianna felt a newfound confidence. This power could help them, could help her protect her friends and defeat their enemies.</p>
<p>As they exited the cave, each lost in their thoughts, Bob looked satisfied. "You like? Good, yes?"</p>
<p>They nodded, although each held a different opinion about what they'd just witnessed. As they resumed their journey towards Cragmaw Castle, Orianna couldn't help but strum her lute, delighting in the richer, fuller sound it now produced, her notes hanging in the air like enchanting fragrances. But amidst the beauty of her music was a new undertone, one of darker things and paths less tread. A complexity that mirrored the very journey they were on, one fraught with choices and consequences, a song of both light and shadow.</p>
<h2 id="cragmaw-castle">Cragmaw castle</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/07-cragmaw.webp" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/07-cragmaw.webp" /></a></p>
<p>The sun cast long, eerie shadows over the ruins as the champions stood before the relic of a fortress known as Cragmaw Castle. Its jagged stones and crumbling towers were in stark contrast to the vibrant wilderness that surrounded it. Vines crept over its walls, and the elements had long since taken their toll on its grandeur. Mortimer considered the air of malevolence that seemed to permeate the very walls of the structure. This was a place where dark deeds had been committed, and where more awaited.</p>
<p>"We have two choices," Vaxidd announced, pointing to the north and south entrances. "Either we take the main entrance to the south or the one camouflaged to the north."</p>
<p>Mortimer, eyes narrowing, raised his staff. With a brief incantation, his owl familiar flew from its perch on his shoulder, soaring into the sky and circling over the castle. "Let's see what we're dealing with," he whispered, his consciousness melding with the owl's.</p>
<p>As the owl glided over the ruin, Mortimer saw through its eyes. Shadows darted and flickered within the castle's hollowed halls, but the details were elusive. There was the unmistakable sound of goblin chatter, along with the clinking and clattering of crockery. No guards patrolled the crumbling battlements, and no archers manned the slits in the walls. The castle's residents were oblivious to the approaching danger.</p>
<p>"Heads up," Mortimer returned to his senses and shared his findings. "The place is alive with activity, but their defenses are lax. They're not expecting visitors."</p>
<p>Sheod grinned, his fingers caressing the fletching of his arrows. "Then let's not disappoint them."</p>
<p>Orianna, feeling the power coursing through her from her new, otherworldly pact, strummed a chord on her lute, her fingertips glowing as she cast a spell of silence around them. They moved as shadows, their footsteps absorbed by the arcane quietude.</p>
<p>Choosing the camouflaged northern entrance seemed the wisest option, and so they did. With a flick of his wrist, Mortimer dispelled the illusion hiding the doorway. Vaxidd led, his shield raised and his eyes narrowed, wariness oozing from every pore. The adventurers tiptoed into the castle, senses heightened, nerves taut as bowstrings. Orianna's silent spell still shielded them, muffling their entrance and enveloping them in an impenetrable quiet.</p>
<p>Inside, the walls closed in like the belly of some great beast. The atmosphere was stifling, heavy with the scent of damp stone and ancient rot. Corridors snaked away into darkness, lit only by the occasional flicker of torchlight. Guttural voices echoed from some distant chamber, snippets of banter and the clatter of weaponry filling the air.</p>
<p>Vaxidd took a deep breath, gripping his sword hilt tightly. "So this is Cragmaw Castle. We must tread carefully; the maze of halls could easily become a trap."</p>
<p>The adventurers nodded, their eyes meeting in quiet agreement. They were in the heart of enemy territory, within walls that had witnessed countless atrocities and schemes. And yet, they moved onward, for they were bound by purpose, driven by a quest that was far from over.</p>
<p>Orianna, her fingers hovering over her lute strings, was ready. She felt the gaze of her new patron upon her, her newfound power a humming tension beneath her skin. Ahead lay danger, dark revelations, and, perhaps, the answers they had all been seeking.</p>
<p>With a silent nod from Vaxidd, they advanced deeper into the structure, unaware of the eyes that began to follow them from the shadowy corners. But whatever lay ahead, the champions of Phandalin were ready. Their journey into the darkness had just begun.</p>
<p>Vaxidd led the way, his armor a silent specter against the murk. They had barely taken a few steps into the decrepit hall when a sudden groan of ancient timber resounded through the eerie stillness. Before anyone could react, part of the ceiling gave way, sending chunks of stone and dust cascading down. Vaxidd threw up his shield, the rubble pelting off its surface with a series of thuds absorbed by the magical quietude.</p>
<p>Mortimer, standing safely out of the fall zone, allowed the hint of a smirk. "Watch your head, Vaxidd. The castle seems to be falling for you."</p>
<p>Vaxidd shook the debris from his shield, casting a wry glance at the mage. "Let's hope that's the only thing in here that does," he retorted, brushing off a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>Their moment of levity was short-lived as they cautiously approached the first doorway. With a collective breath, they readied themselves for whatever lay beyond. The door swung inward, revealing a chamber that chilled the blood in their veins.</p>
<p>Nezz, the drow they had encountered before, was there, her cold eyes flickering with malevolent glee. In her grasp was a wand, its nature and power indeterminate, but clearly of a dangerous provenance. Beside her loomed a bugbear, its size and ferocity dwarfing any they had seen before. They stood in the midst of an argument, the bugbear's low growls a bass counterpoint to Nezz's sibilant hisses.</p>
<p>The adventurers didn't hesitate. Battle stances were assumed with practiced ease. Orianna’s fingers danced across her lute, the air around her shimmering with the onset of a melody that sang of courage and dread. Sheod’s arrows notched silently, his eyes narrowing as he sought out his targets.</p>
<p>Vaxidd stepped forward, shield at the ready, the light glinting off his sword. "It seems we have unfinished business," he announced, the power of his voice breaking through the silent spell with command and intent.</p>
<p>Nezz sneered, her gaze locked onto the warriors before her. "Indeed, it is a pity you won't live to regret this intrusion," she hissed, her grip tightening on the wand.</p>
<p>Mortimer raised his staff, arcane power coalescing at its tip. "I'd say it's you who should be full of regrets," he quipped, the air crackling with his impending spell.</p>
<p>With no words left to waste, the tension snapped like a bowstring. Combat erupted, the champions of Phandalin moving as one against the darkness that sought to overwhelm them. This was their moment, a fight not just for survival, but for the very soul of the land they had sworn to protect.</p>
<p>Electric tension charged the air as Nezz brandished her wand, a malevolent chant spilling from her lips. A bolt of lightning surged forth, a blinding arc of raw energy that hungered for its targets. Vaxidd, Mortimer, and Orianna were caught in its wrathful path; their bodies seized by the cruel voltage, muscles contracting, cries stifled by the thunderous crack that followed.</p>
<p>Through the chaos, Sheod moved like a shadow. He dodged the deadly streak with a grace born of countless hours in the wild, his response a swift arrow released from taut string. It sailed, a thin promise of vengeance, and struck Nezz. A mere graze upon her flesh, it was an irritant rather than a wound, yet it earned a hiss of pain and surprise from the dark rogue.</p>
<p>Mortimer, shaking off the singeing pain, focused his wrath into a spell. His voice rose above the din, a litany of incantation that culminated in a volley of arcane darts. The magic missiles streaked across the room, a constellation of destructive intent that hammered into Nezz with unerring precision.</p>
<p>Orianna, the melody of battle upon her lips, summoned her own brand of retribution. The Dissonant Whispers wove through the air, a symphony of psychic torment that sought the drow’s mind. Nezz clutched at her temples, her face twisted in agony as the dissonance clawed at her sanity.</p>
<p>All the while, Vaxidd engaged King Grol in a deadly dance. He pressed the bugbear back, shield and sword a barrier between the monstrous brute and his vulnerable comrades. His every move was a statement, his every block a declaration that this beast would not pass.</p>
<p>In a corner, barely discernible beneath the shadow of battle, lay Gundren Rockseeker. The dwarf was bound and unconscious, oblivious to the violence that sought to claim his fate.</p>
<p>Nezz, rage contorting her features, raised the wand again, whispering dark promises to the twisted magic within. But fate is fickle, and as she unleashed her spell, it sputtered and died, a damp squib of power that left her snarling in frustration.</p>
<p>"You should've chosen a more reliable tool," Mortimer jeered, the taste of victory sweet upon his tongue.</p>
<p>"Your magic is as weak as your resolve," Orianna added, her voice ringing clear, the power of her song undiminished despite the lightning’s kiss.</p>
<p>Vaxidd saw the moment, the brief falter in Nezz's stance, the opening he had been waiting for. "Your time is up, Nezz. The light always finds a way," he declared, his voice a stalwart rumble as he tightened his grip, ready to end the standoff with King Grol and turn the tide of battle.</p>
<p>A sudden, surreal twist engulfed the chamber as Nezz's slender fingers conjured yet another enchantment from her enigmatic wand. In an instant, the room filled with a kaleidoscope of iridescent butterflies, their ephemeral wings a hypnotic dance that obscured vision and played tricks on the senses.</p>
<p>King Grol and Vaxidd, the blind combatants, swayed and weaved in a chaotic waltz, their strikes mere shadows in the dazzling whirl of colors. The bugbear's growls and the paladin's grunts of effort painted an odd symphony amidst the surreal, fluttering landscape.</p>
<p>Orianna, ever attuned to the ebb and flow of magic, felt the disturbance ripple through the room. She knew there was but one way to pierce this fanciful façade. With a resounding crescendo of sound that seemed to drown out even the chaotic butterflies, she cast Thunderclap. The concussive force blasted through the room, a shockwave of sound that struck with divine fury. The butterflies around her fell silent, their delicate forms shattered into a cascade of shimmering motes, revealing Nezz standing amidst the swirling chaos.</p>
<p>Sheod, seizing the opportunity, drew his bowstring taut, his true arrow seeking its mark. Mortimer, never one to be outdone, focused his magic into a trio of scorching rays, the fiery lances of power streaming toward the drow rogue.</p>
<p>In that suspended moment of clarity, Nezz's dark eyes widened, her lips parting in futile protest. The arrows and rays struck true, and a symphony of agony echoed in her final breath. Her form crumpled to the ground, the butterflies fading into oblivion as life slipped away.</p>
<p>"Looks like her magic wasn't enough to save her this time," Mortimer remarked with a smirk.</p>
<p>Sheod gave a nod of approval. "A fitting end for a rogue like her."</p>
<p>Vaxidd, breathing heavily, turned to King Grol, who stood alone amidst the dissipating swarm of butterflies. "Your move, bugbear." With a sudden, desperate lunge, he launched himself at Vaxidd, his eyes filled with a vengeful fire. The paladin's reflexes, honed by countless battles and a steadfast commitment to his companions, kicked in without hesitation.</p>
<p>With a swift and mighty swing, Vaxidd's warhammer found its mark, crashing into King Grol's chest with bone-crushing force. The bugbear's defiant charge was abruptly halted as he crumbled to the ground, his life extinguished in an instant.</p>
<p>The chamber was filled with the aftermath of violence, the echoes of betrayal still ringing in the air. Vaxidd, his warhammer poised and dripping with the remnants of his enemy, cast a solemn glance over the fallen bugbear. "Such is the fate of those who choose the path of treachery."</p>
<p>The party, their collective breaths held in shock, exchanged glances of disbelief and determination. The dangers that lurked within Cragmaw Castle had tested them in ways they could never have foreseen, but they stood undaunted, their bond forged in the crucible of their trials.</p>
<p>With Nezz and King Grol now vanquished, they were one step closer to unraveling the mysteries that had led them to this point. But the heart of their journey still lay ahead, and the challenges awaiting them in the shadows of Cragmaw Castle were yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>As the party caught their breath and turned their attention to Nezz's lifeless form, they were met with a shocking revelation. Nezz's body seemed to shift and contort, as if her very form were in flux. It was then that the truth emerged – she was not who she had appeared to be. A doppelganger, a master of deception and mimicry, had taken her place.</p>
<p>Mortimer, ever resourceful and quick-witted, knew that this situation required answers. He reached into his arcane knowledge and conjured a spell to speak with the dead. With a solemn incantation, he touched the doppelganger's lifeless body, invoking the magic that would allow him to glean information from beyond the grave.</p>
<p>The doppelganger's eyes flickered open, their gaze vacant yet haunting. Mortimer posed his question, his voice carrying a weight of curiosity and urgency. "Tell us, doppelganger, what secrets lie within Cragmaw Castle? Where can we find the map to the Wave Echo Cave?"</p>
<p>The doppelganger's voice, cold and detached, echoed within the chamber as it spoke. "Under the bed... where Gundar lies unconscious." The cryptic words hung in the air, a clue to their next destination.</p>
<p>With the information in hand, the party swiftly turned their attention to Gundar Rockseeker, the dwarf who had been bound and unconscious in the corner. They approached the bed where he lay, their hearts filled with a mix of hope and anticipation. The journey ahead was far from over, and the map to the Wave Echo Cave held the promise of answers and revelations that would shape their destiny.</p>
<p>But as they prepared to search for the hidden map, the realization dawned upon them that the shadows of treachery and deception still loomed large. The doppelganger's presence was a grim reminder that their enemies were cunning and elusive, and that the challenges they faced would require not only strength but also unwavering vigilance.</p>

The doppelganger's presence was a grim reminder that their enemies were cunning and elusive, and that the challenges they faced would require not only strength but also unwavering vigilance.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, always the protector, couldn't help but voice his concerns. "Be on your guard, my friends. This doppelganger's presence suggests that we are dealing with a web of deceit and betrayal. Let us not underestimate our foes."</p>
<p>Orianna, with a reassuring smile, added, "And let's not forget that we have each other. Together, we can unravel any mystery and overcome any obstacle."</p>
<p>Mortimer, his mind already racing with thoughts of the arcane and the unknown, nodded in agreement. "Indeed, we shall face whatever challenges lie ahead with courage and determination. But first, let us retrieve that map and continue our quest."</p>
<p>Sheod, ever the keen-eyed ranger, scanned their surroundings for any signs of danger. "We've come this far, and we won't be deterred now. Let's find that map and make our next move."</p>
<p>With renewed purpose and a shared resolve, the champions turned their attention to the task at hand – locating the hidden map that would lead them to the Wave Echo Cave. As they began their search, the echoes of their recent battle faded into the background, replaced by the anticipation of what lay ahead in the dimly lit chambers of Cragmaw Castle.</p>
<h2 id="glasstaff">Glasstaff</h2>
<p>As the champions pressed deeper into the labyrinthine corridors of Cragmaw Castle, their footsteps echoing through the ancient stones, Mortimer, the scholarly spellcaster, couldn't resist the urge to add a bit of dramatic flair to their daring infiltration.</p>
<p>With a sly grin, he waved his hands and chanted in a theatrical tone, "Behold, the return of the mighty Vaxidd!" In an instant, an illusion of their paladin companion, Vaxidd, materialized before the party. The illusory Vaxidd stood tall and imposing, his imaginary warhammer gleaming menacingly.</p>
<p>The goblins, well-known for their penchant for panic and chaos, reacted just as Mortimer had hoped. One of them, with wide, terrified eyes, squealed, "Vaxidd! He's back to haunt us!"</p>
<p>Another goblin, brandishing a crooked staff, shouted in agreement, "This is it! The end is nigh! We must destroy the imposter!"</p>
<p>Their frenzied cries echoed through the corridor as they launched a barrage of spells, arrows, and even a flying cauldron at the illusory Vaxidd.</p>
<p>But the real champions were already in action, moving with practiced precision. Sheod, the sharp-eyed ranger, sent a flurry of arrows flying, each one finding a goblin target with remarkable accuracy. Orianna, the bard with a knack for magical manipulation, wove a melody of dissonant whispers that further unraveled their foes' composure.</p>
<p>Mortimer, still wearing his sly grin, brandished his staff with a flourish and delivered resounding blows to the goblins. It was a performance that would have made any bard proud, and he couldn't help but add a cheeky comment as he struck his foes, "I always knew I had a knack for the dramatic!"</p>
<p>Glasstaff, the once-enigmatic wizard, found himself caught in the midst of the chaos, his plans unraveling faster than a poorly woven tapestry. The bugbear, once the embodiment of arrogance, was now faced with the illusion of Vaxidd's warhammer, and his bravado crumbled.</p>
<p>The goblins, now the hunted instead of the hunters, were clearly outmatched and outwitted. Their frantic tactics had backfired spectacularly.</p>
<p>In a desperate bid to escape, Glasstaff made a run for it, casting protective shield spells to deflect their attacks. The chase that followed was nothing short of comical, with spells and arrows flying haphazardly in all directions.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his eyebrows raised in mock seriousness, shouted to his comrades, "Keep your eyes on the prize, folks! We're playing 'Tag the Wizard,' and I'm it!"</p>
<p>Sheod, a sly grin on his face, quipped, "Iarno, you're fast, but can you dodge an arrow and a punchline at the same time?"</p>
<p>Orianna, with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, added, "Looks like someone skipped 'Escaping Heroes 101' in wizard school!"</p>
<p>Mortimer, as he cast spells, couldn't resist a pun, "Glasstaff, I hope you brought your running shoes because this chase is electrifying!"</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/07-glasstaff.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/07-glasstaff.png" /></a></p>
<p>The goblins who watched the chaotic pursuit could only exchange bewildered glances as the heroes and the fleeing wizard weaved through the castle's twists and turns. Spells ricocheted off walls, arrows whizzed past, and the once-imposing Glasstaff found himself running in circles.</p>
<p>Glasstaff, trying to catch his breath between spells, muttered, "Note to self: next time, challenge adventurers who take their humor as seriously as their magic."</p>
<p>As the chase raged on, laughter mixed with the sounds of spells and footsteps, turning what should have been a dire confrontation into a comedic spectacle for anyone fortunate enough to witness it.</p>
<p>But fate ad something in store. Sheod, always the patient one, took aim and let loose a true arrow that found its mark, sending Glasstaff tumbling to the ground in a most ungraceful manner.</p>
<p>As the echoes of victory reverberated through the castle's stone halls, Mortimer couldn't help but quip, "Well, that was quite the performance, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>With their foe vanquished and the goblins thoroughly bewildered, the champions stood amidst the remnants of their theatrical battle, ready to press forward into the unknown. For in the heart of Cragmaw Castle, there were still more secrets to uncover, and undoubtedly, more comedic twists and turns awaiting them.</p>
<h2 id="bob-the-goblin-king">Bob the Goblin King</h2>
<p>As the dust settled and the echoes of battle waned, the champions caught their breath, their victorious spirits lifting the weight of their earlier confrontation. They exchanged glances, smiles of triumph on their faces, their camaraderie deepening with each challenge they overcame.</p>
<p>But their moment of respite was short-lived, for on the horizon, a peculiar sight greeted them. A sizable goblin force, roughly twenty-strong, dominated the center of the approaching group. Among them, a goblin of grotesque proportions perched atop the shoulders of his kin, his massive frame defying all expectations. The adventurers, momentarily taken aback, soon recognized the unmistakable figure of their old "friend" Bob, the goblin who had once been a thorn in their side.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/07-goblin-king.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/07-goblin-king.png" /></a></p>
<p>Bob's visage was a mix of half-hearted friendliness and veiled menace as he regarded the party. His voice boomed with newfound authority as he declared, "Halt! In the name of King Bob, ruler of this castle, you shall surrender all that you have found within these walls!"</p>
<p>Vaxidd, never one to back down from a challenge, stepped forward, his shield raised and his brow furrowed in determination. "And who crowned you king, Bob? Last time I checked, you were a goblin nuisance."</p>
<p>Bob, now King Bob, corrected with a regal air, "Aye, that's right! I've upgraded from nuisance to royalty, thanks to the goblin vote of confidence!"</p>
<p>Sheod, with his usual dry wit, quipped, "Ah, democracy at its finest. Who knew goblins were such avid supporters of your rule?"</p>
<p>Mortimer, always calculating, took a step closer to Bob. "Now, King Bob, let's talk about this. We've been through quite a bit in this castle, and we might be willing to negotiate."</p>
<p>Orianna, her bardic charm not to be underestimated, added with a twinkle in her eye, "We could use a goblin ally in our adventures, couldn't we?"</p>
<p>King Bob's expression wavered, torn between his newfound authority and the prospect of an alliance. The goblins surrounding him exchanged uncertain glances, unsure of how their king should proceed.</p>
<p>As the goblin King Bob, with his rotund figure and an air of both friendliness and menace, demanded the adventurers surrender their newfound treasures, the tension in the room thickened. The goblins gathered around, some brandishing rusty weapons, while others wore expressions of greedy anticipation.</p>
<p>Mortimer, always quick-witted and ready for a challenge, decided to use his arcane talents to turn the tide. With a sly grin, he conjured the illusion of a fearsome dragon, its scales gleaming and wings outstretched. The goblins, at first startled, gasped and took a few steps back, their eyes wide with terror.</p>
<p>But Mortimer wasn't finished yet. He couldn't resist adding a touch of humor to the situation. "Behold, King Bob!" he announced dramatically, gesturing toward the illusory dragon. "The fearsome guardian of our treasure, ready to roast anyone who dares approach!"</p>
<p>The goblins exchanged bewildered glances, unsure of how to respond. King Bob, however, wasn't one to back down easily. "Nice try, magic man," he growled, his tone a mixture of irritation and bravado. "But no illusion can fool the mighty Bob! Now, hand over the loot, or my goblins here will make sure you're extra crispy!"</p>
<p>Mortimer, undeterred, chuckled and raised an eyebrow. "You know, I always heard goblins had a taste for treasure, but who knew they also had a taste for barbecue?" With a sly grin, he focused his telekinetic powers on the scroll he had discovered on Glasstaff's lifeless form.</p>
<p>With an incantation and a flick of his finger, the scroll sprang to life, and a bead of fiery light shot forth, landing in the midst of the goblin horde. The room erupted in a deafening explosion of flames and chaos, sending goblins tumbling and screeching in all directions.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/07-fireball.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/07-fireball.png" /></a></p>
<p>As the smoke cleared, King Bob found himself singed and soot-covered but miraculously alive. He coughed and spluttered, his confidence shaken. "Okay, okay, maybe we can work something out," he stammered, a touch of desperation in his voice.</p>
<p>Mortimer couldn't help but smirk. "That's the spirit, King Bob! Now, let's have a civilized chat about sharing, shall we?" The goblins, still reeling from their fiery encounter, reluctantly agreed to a more peaceful negotiation.</p>
<p>With the treasure dispute resolved (largely in the adventurers' favor), the unlikely allies forged an agreement. The goblins, now convinced that these adventurers were not to be trifled with, decided to leave the heroes to their own devices and explore other opportunities for mischief.</p>
<p>As the adventurers departed from the goblin lair, their encounter with King Bob and his band of merry troublemakers left them with a tale to tell and a newfound appreciation for the unpredictable twists of their journey.</p>
<h2 id="return-to-phandalin">return to Phandalin</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/07-phandalin.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/07-phandalin.png" /></a></p>
<p>As the heroes returned to Phandalin, they were greeted with a sight that took them by surprise. The once-infamous Redbrand hideout, a place that had harbored darkness and lawlessness, had been transformed into something entirely unexpected.</p>
<p>The townsfolk of Phandalin had taken it upon themselves to renovate the hideout, turning it into a new headquarters for the adventurers. The mayor, a shrewd and charismatic individual, had rallied the villagers with a vision of the heroes as the new protectors of Phandalin. It seemed that the influence of the adventurers had taken root not only in their deeds but in the hearts of the people as well.</p>
<p>As they approached the hideout, the heroes couldn't help but exchange surprised glances. The building that had once been a den of iniquity now stood as a symbol of hope and rejuvenation. Freshly painted walls, repaired roofs, and a new sign bearing the emblem of the adventurers adorned the exterior.</p>
<p>Inside, the hideout had been transformed into a bustling hub of activity. Villagers worked together to set up training areas, storage rooms, and even a makeshift tavern. The air was filled with the sound of hammering, laughter, and the clinking of tankards.</p>
<p>The mayor, a beaming figure in the midst of it all, approached the heroes with open arms. "Welcome back, my friends! I trust you find our little surprise to your liking?"</p>
<p>Vaxidd, the ever-dutiful paladin, couldn't help but smile at the unexpected turn of events. "You've certainly outdone yourselves, Mayor. This is more than we could have ever imagined."</p>
<p>Orianna, with her bardic charm, added, "It's like coming back to a completely different Phandalin."</p>
<p>Mortimer, the pragmatic wizard, raised an eyebrow. "I must admit, I had my doubts, but this is quite impressive."</p>
<p>Sheod, the stoic ranger, nodded in agreement. "It's a fitting tribute to the resilience of this town."</p>
<p>The mayor chuckled. "Well, we thought it was high time Phandalin had a place to call its own, and who better to protect it than the very heroes who have saved us time and time again?"</p>
<p>The heroes exchanged glances once more, a sense of responsibility settling over them. It seemed that their journey was far from over, and their role in Phandalin had taken on new meaning. As they settled into their renovated headquarters, they couldn't help but wonder what adventures and challenges lay ahead, and how they would continue to shape the destiny of the town they had come to call home.</p>
<p>The heroes made their way to the Twilight Refuge, the inn owned by Orianna's father, seeking a moment of respite and a chance to plan their next moves. With Gundran safely in their care, the atmosphere in the inn was one of both gratitude and tension.</p>
<p>Orianna took the lead, her voice carrying the weight of their recent adventures as she regaled her father with the tale of their encounters, from the goblin ambush to the treacherous depths of Cragmaw Castle. Her storytelling was animated, punctuated by vivid descriptions and the occasional flourish to make the events come alive.</p>
<p>Her father, a stout and welcoming figure, listened intently, his face reflecting a range of emotions – concern, pride, and a touch of apprehension. When Orianna concluded her narrative, he let out a sigh that seemed to release the tension he had been holding.</p>
<p>"Gundran, I can't thank you enough for what you've done for my daughter and her companions," he said, his voice filled with gratitude. "You're a hero in your own right, and we owe you a debt of gratitude."</p>
<p>Gundran, seated nearby and still recovering from his ordeal, nodded appreciatively. "I'm just glad to be alive, and I owe it to these fine adventurers."</p>
<p>As the conversation continued, Gundran shifted his attention to the matter at hand. "But we mustn't forget our purpose. We need to reach Wave Echo Cave as soon as possible. Time is of the essence."</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/07-gundran.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/07-gundran.png" /></a></p>
<p>The mention of the cave and its history hung heavy in the air. Fifteen miles east of Phandalin, in the deep vales of the Sword Mountains, Wave Echo Cave held the promise of both riches and peril. It was a place steeped in legend, where the Phandelver's Pact had once flourished before being lost to the ravages of time and orc invasions.</p>
<p>Gundran's account of the Rockseeker brothers' discovery and the subsequent treachery that had led to their current predicament was a stark reminder of the dangers they faced. Nezznar, the Black Spider, and his insidious plans loomed over them like a shadow.</p>
<p>The heroes knew that they had a chance to aid Gundran, avenge his kin, and put an end to the Black Spider's nefarious schemes. The lure of the Forge of Spells, where powerful enchantments had once been crafted, added to their determination. But they also understood that Wave Echo Cave was fraught with peril, inhabited by undead and dangerous monsters that would test their mettle.</p>
<p>With a day of preparation ahead, the adventurers set to work. Mortimer, the scholarly spellcaster, busied himself with preparing scrolls and spells that would aid them in the challenges to come. Vaxidd delved into the history of the cave, learning of its connection to the temple of Moradin and the magic it held. Sheod, the astute ranger, studied the map, seeking tactical advantages and potential routes within the cave.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Orianna's resourcefulness led her to the local mage, and together they discovered a teleportation scroll that could potentially take them directly to Wave Echo Cave, bypassing the treacherous journey through the Sword Mountains.</p>
<p>As the evening wore on and their preparations neared completion, the heroes found themselves at a crossroads, ready to embark on the next leg of their journey. The promise of riches, the chance to thwart the Black Spider's plans, and the mysteries of Wave Echo Cave beckoned. It was a moment of both excitement and trepidation, a culmination of their adventures thus far and the beginning of a new chapter in their quest.</p>
<p>With their resolve steeled and their preparations in place, the heroes readied themselves for the challenges that awaited, knowing that the fate of Phandalin and the legacy of Wave Echo Cave hung in the balance.</p>
<h1 id="day-8">Day 8</h1>
<h2 id="to-the-wave-echo-cave">To the Wave Echo Cave</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/08-wave-echo-cave.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/08-wave-echo-cave.png" /></a></p>
<p>As the party materialized within the narrow tunnel hidden in the foothills of the Sword Mountains, the abrupt transition from Phandalin's serenity to the dark, cavernous depths of the earth left them momentarily disoriented. Orianna, with her musical grace, was the first to regain her bearings. She looked around, her gaze sweeping the cavern that unfolded before them.</p>
<p>The entrance tunnel led them into a vast underground chamber, its boundaries marked by towering stalagmites that reached toward the heavens like ancient sentinels of stone. Natural pillars of rock supported the massive weight of the earth above, and the air was filled with the earthy scent of dampness and age. It was a stark contrast to the open skies and rolling hills they had grown accustomed to.</p>
<p>Sheod, always vigilant, took a cautious step forward, his keen elven senses alert to any potential threats. Vaxidd, the unwavering protector, held his shield high, ready to defend his companions. Mortimer, the enigmatic scholar, adjusted his spectacles and surveyed their surroundings with a mix of curiosity and trepidation.</p>
<p>The party's entrance didn't go unnoticed. In the western part of the cavern, behind a massive column of rock, their eyes fell upon an unexpected sight—three simple bedrolls and a haphazard collection of supplies strewn about. Sacks of flour, bags of salt, and casks of salted meat mingled with lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other mining gear. Among this utilitarian clutter lay the lifeless form of a dwarf miner, his fate sealed in the depths of the earth at least a week prior.</p>
<p>Orianna's expression shifted from curiosity to somberness as she recognized the tragic scene. "This was the campsite of the Rockseekers," she murmured, her voice carrying the weight of the realization. "Tharden... Gundren's brother," she added, the name spoken like a solemn epitaph for the fallen dwarf.</p>
<p>Vaxidd's eyes narrowed with determination. "And Nundro is the Black Spider's prisoner," he stated, his voice leaving no room for doubt. The fate of their friend and ally hung heavily in the air, a stark reminder of the urgency of their mission.</p>
<p>The supplies, while not particularly valuable, still held the potential for usefulness. The adventurers surveyed the assortment of gear, contemplating their choices. Mortimer, ever the pragmatist, examined the items with an eye for practicality. "These supplies might come in handy down the line," he remarked, his fingers tracing the outlines of pickaxes and shovels.</p>
<p>Amid the myriad of objects, a sturdy hemp rope caught Sheod's attention. It was tied off securely around a nearby stalagmite and dangled down the side of a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit that marred the northeastern section of the cavern. The pit was an ominous reminder of the dangers that lurked beneath the earth's surface.</p>
<p>With a nod of agreement, Orianna added, "That rope could be essential for our descent into the unknown. We should make sure to take it with us."</p>
<p>The party's options lay before them, illuminated only by the faint glow of lanterns and the dim light filtering through the stalactites above. The choices they made in this moment would determine the path they followed deeper into the heart of Wave Echo Cave, where the shadows of the past and the looming threat of the Black Spider awaited their arrival.</p>
<p>As the party stood on the precipice of the pit, uncertainty lingering in the air like a shroud, Mortimer couldn't resist the urge to inject a bit of levity into the situation. His voice, tinged with playful sarcasm, broke the silence that had settled over the group.</p>
<p>"Ah, you know, it's moments like these that make me truly appreciate my profession," he quipped, adjusting his spectacles with exaggerated theatrics. "I mean, who doesn't love spelunking in the pitch-black unknown with nothing but a few lanterns and the hope that gravity is on our side?"</p>
<p>Vaxidd, his stoic demeanor unyielding, gave Mortimer an unamused glance. "Quit your jesting, Mortimer. We have a mission to accomplish, and we can't afford any missteps."</p>
<p>Mortimer chuckled in response, his voice lighthearted despite the gravity of their situation. "Oh, come now, my dear paladin. I'm just trying to shed some light on the situation, or lack thereof. Besides, I can't see a thing down there. Perhaps our brave protector should lead the way, shining his beacon of righteousness into the abyss."</p>
<p>Vaxidd, ever the dutiful guardian, didn't need any more encouragement. He stepped forward, shield raised, and began the descent into the pit with resolute determination. The rest of the party followed suit, their lanterns casting flickering shadows on the cavern walls as they descended into the unknown depths.</p>
<p>Mortimer's jests may have added a touch of humor to their journey, but the looming presence of Wave Echo Cave and the weight of their mission were never far from their minds. With each step into the darkness, they drew closer to uncovering the secrets of the past and confronting the menacing threat of the Black Spider, their resolve unshaken by the challenges that lay ahead.</p>
<h2 id="the-large-room">The large room</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/08-guardroom.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/08-guardroom.png" /></a></p>
<p>The party ventured deeper into the heart of the cavern, their lanterns casting eerie shadows on the rough-hewn walls. The air was heavy with the weight of history and the lingering remnants of a battle fought long ago. As they reached the threshold of the old guardroom, the grim scene that unfolded before them spoke of the tragedy that had befallen the dwarves and orcs who once called this place their stronghold.</p>
<p>Splintered stone benches and piles of rubble lay scattered about, bearing witness to the violence that had torn through the chamber. Broken bunks and toppled weapon racks whispered tales of a desperate last stand. And amidst the debris, the skeletal remains of both dwarves and orcs lay as silent witnesses to the past.</p>
<p>The party approached cautiously, their eyes scanning the room for any signs of danger. It was then that the drow ranger, Sheod, took a bold step forward, crossing the threshold into the chamber. In an instant, the bones that had lain dormant for centuries began to stir, a macabre dance of reanimation.</p>
<p>Sheod retreated with lightning speed, the skeletons crumbling back down to the floor as if only the presence of the living awakened the skeletons. The adventurers stood at the precipice of a battle they hadn't anticipated, their weapons drawn and their resolve steeled.</p>
<p>"Well, that is certainly a bone-chilling encounter! But don't worry, folks, I've always believed in a fair fight – after all, it's only fair that we get all these nifty weapons, right?" Mortimer, the ever-cunning spellcaster, saw an opportunity amidst the chaos. With a flick of his fingers and a focused concentration, he summoned his telekinetic powers. One by one, the weapons, shields, and helmets that had once belonged to the fallen dwarves and orcs lifted into the air, hovering in a spectral display of force.</p>
<p>With delicate precision, Mortimer brought the weapons and equipment out of the room, each piece floating effortlessly into the waiting hands of the adventurers. Spirits high, they ventured back into the chamber, now facing a legion of unarmed skeletons.</p>
<p>The battle that followed was a testament to their teamwork and ingenuity. The skeletons, devoid of weapons, were no match for the champions as they fought with a coordinated effort that left no room for hesitation. Blades clashed, magic crackled, and the skeletal foes were dismantled one by one, reduced to lifeless bones once more.</p>
<p>As the last skeleton crumbled, the chamber fell silent, save for the ragged breaths of the victorious adventurers. They exchanged glances, a mix of relief and triumph in their eyes. The old guardroom, once a place of death and despair, had become a testament to their resourcefulness and resilience. With their newfound gear and a renewed sense of purpose, they continued their descent into the depths of Wave Echo Cave, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.</p>
<h2 id="the-poisonous-cavern">The Poisonous Cavern</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/08-fungi-cave.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/08-fungi-cave.png" /></a></p>
<p>The adventurers cautiously entered the cavern, their senses alert to the strange and eerie environment that surrounded them. The fungi-covered floor stretched out before them, an otherworldly landscape of puffballs, shelf fungus, and towering stalks and caps. The occasional eerie green glow from the puffballs provided an eerie, ethereal illumination, casting long, shifting shadows that danced on the cave walls.</p>
<p>As they ventured deeper into the cave, the sound of distant waves grew louder, echoing through the subterranean chamber. It was a curious sensation, being so far below the surface yet feeling the presence of the ocean's relentless embrace.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, ever the stalwart guardian of the group, led the way, his armored boots making a soft but resolute thud with each step. He moved with caution, knowing that danger could lurk in the most unexpected places.</p>
<p>However, the cave had a treacherous surprise in store for them. As Vaxidd set his foot upon the fungal carpet that covered the cave floor, the air suddenly filled with noxious gas. It billowed up from the fungi, enveloping the adventurers in a choking haze. Vaxidd, with his robust dwarven constitution, resisted the worst of its effects, but the rest of the party wasn't so fortunate.</p>
<p>Coughing and spluttering, the adventurers found themselves poisoned by the toxic gas, their vision blurred and their movements sluggish. They knew they needed to act fast if they were to escape the deadly cloud.</p>
<p>Mortimer, always ready with a clever solution, called for the party to step aside. With a twinkle in his eye and a flourish of his fingers, he mimicked guns and began firing firebolts at the fungi. The fiery bolts of magic seared through the growth, igniting it in a spectacular display of flames. The burning fungi released even more gas into the air, creating a swirling vortex of fire and poison.</p>
<p>The adventurers watched with a mix of awe and concern as Mortimer's fiery path gradually cleared a safe passage through the cave. The noxious gas, while still present, began to disperse, allowing the party to breathe easier. It took several tense minutes, but the combined efforts of Mortimer and his magical flames had created a navigable path.</p>
<p>As the last tendrils of poisonous gas faded away, the adventurers were finally able to move forward, their steps cautious but determined. The eerie, phosphorescent glow of the remaining fungi cast an otherworldly light on their path, guiding them deeper into the mysterious cavern.</p>
<p>With their encounter with the poisonous fungi behind them, the adventurers pressed on, the waves of the hidden ocean growing louder with each passing moment. They knew that greater challenges and mysteries lay ahead, but they were undeterred, for they were the champions of Phandalin, and the call of adventure beckoned them ever onward.</p>
<h2 id="the-wizard">The Wizard</h2>
<p>The adventurers entered the cavern with awe as the glittering minerals in the ceiling created a mesmerizing illusion of a starry night sky. The skeletons scattered across the floor and the battered stone buildings spoke of a past tragedy.</p>
<p>As they approached the northern building, its cracked doors loomed before them. Mortimer, with his usual enthusiasm, remarked, "Ah, it seems we've found ourselves a room with a view, friends. Shall we see what treasures or terrors lie within?"</p>
<p>Vaxidd, cautious but curious, took a step forward and replied, "We've faced our fair share of terrors. I say we proceed, but stay vigilant."</p>
<p>With a collective nod, they forced open the doors with a resounding creak. The room beyond revealed the aftermath of a destructive blast. Furnishings lay in charred disarray, but something caught their eye—a scorched iron chest near the foot of one of the beds.</p>
<p>Just as they began to investigate, a chilling presence manifested itself before them. Mormesk, the wraith, materialized out of the floor. His voice, like the whispers of the grave, filled the room.</p>
<p>"Your presence is offensive to me, your life forfeit. My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!" Mormesk's words were laden with centuries of anger and hatred.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/08-mormesk.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/08-mormesk.png" /></a></p>
<p>Orianna, ever the diplomat, attempted to reason with the vengeful wraith. "Mormesk, we don't seek to plunder your treasures. We're here for a different purpose. Perhaps we can come to an understanding."</p>
<p>Mortimer chimed in, his tone sly, "Yes, you see, we're quite the collectors ourselves. We value magic items, arcane knowledge, and scrolls. What do you say, old friend? A fair exchange?"</p>
<p>Mormesk regarded them, his spectral form wavering. "Very well, offer something of value in exchange for your lives."</p>
<p>As Mormesk hovered, Mortimer could not help but notice a large scroll in the corner on top of a dusty chest. As Mortimer's telekinesis gently lifted the large scroll from the dusty chest, Mormesk's ethereal form shivered with fury. He hissed through translucent teeth, "You dare touch what is not yours, thieves!"</p>
<p>Orianna, her voice trembling with unease, tried to reason with the enraged wraith. "Mormesk, we meant no harm. We merely saw something of interest. Perhaps we can—"</p>
<p>But her words were cut short as Mormesk, consumed by wrath, lunged at them with spectral claws extended. His touch sent a chill through their souls, and they knew that reasoning was futile.</p>
<p>The room erupted into chaos as the adventurers defended themselves from the vengeful wraith. Spells crackled through the air, and Mortimer summoned a protective shield to ward off the wraith's ethereal attacks.</p>
<p>In the midst of the frantic battle, Sheod, quick-witted as ever, noticed the specter's fixation on the stolen scroll. With a swift motion, he snatched the scroll from Mortimer's grasp and dashed towards the exit, luring Mormesk in pursuit.</p>
<p>The wraith, driven by an insatiable desire for the scroll, followed Sheod through the corridors of the building. As he gave chase, Mormesk's spectral form grew increasingly frenzied, his hatred for the intruders overshadowed by his single-minded pursuit of the stolen item.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vaxidd seized the opportunity, his warhammer gleaming with divine purpose. With a resounding cry, he swung his weapon with all his might, the force of his blow connecting with Mormesk's spectral form.</p>
<p>The wraith let out a guttural howl of anguish as the divine energy coursed through him. "You shall not escape, thief!" he wailed, but it was too late. Vaxidd's strike had found its mark, and Mormesk's form dissipated into an eerie mist, vanishing into the ether.</p>
<p>The room fell silent, save for the heavy breathing of the adventurers, their bodies still tingling from the encounter. With the wraith defeated, they turned their attention back to the stolen scroll, now safe in Sheod's hands, and contemplated their next move in the labyrinthine caves of Wave Echo Cave.</p>

<p>Orianna is a 30-year-old Tiefling in the prime of her life. Her skin color is pink, her hair is dark purple, and her eyes are red. Standing at a width of only 1.65cm, Orianna has several differences compared to her siblings who have purple skin and much darker hair. However, they share the same eye color and horn shape.</p>
<p>As the only child in the middle of three siblings, Orianna dislikes being the youngest to help the party due to her overprotective family. Growing up, she was never allowed to be alone with other cubs or teenagers without one of her brothers nearby to ensure her safety.</p>
<p>Her family runs a tavern/station called Twilight Refuge's in Phandelven where she learned to sing, dance, and play the violin and flute with troupes that passed by. Her desire to learn about the world and adventurers she heard about in songs led her to finally convince her parents to let her go with a troupe at the age of 18.</p>
<p>During her travels with the troupe, Orianna had the opportunity to perform in various places and meet adventurers up to royalty. She eventually learned the art of being a bard and formed a friendship with Mortimer, a wizard who worked in the library of the academy of magic in Neverwinter as a librarian and scribe. Mortimer taught her various stories and legends of Mages and other adventurers who became great heroes in all corners of the world.</p>
<p>It was from Mortimer that Orianna met Gundram Rockseeker, a nomadic dwarf trader, and Vaxidd, a paladin who happened to be Gundram's cousin. Orianna didn't know much about them, but Mortimer respected them, so she did the same.</p>
<p>Several years later, Gundram contacted Mortimer with an unusual request. He needed a security escort for a caravan carrying goods and believed that Orianna and a few other adventurers were the right people for the job. Initially hesitant, Orianna agreed to go when she heard that they would pass through Phandelven. She missed her family and hoped to find inspiration for another song during her adventure.</p>

<p>Mortimer is a 54-year-old human with a lean and wiry build. He has a scholarly and unassuming figure, with a hint of hidden strength and a keen intelligence lurking behind his unassuming facade. Despite his age, he moves with a surprising grace and agility. He stands tall at 6’, with a slightly stooped posture from years spent hunched over books and parchment. His face is lined with wrinkles, evidence of a life spent indoors under the dim light of candles and oil lamps. His hair is a greying brown colour, long enough to reach his shoulders. He wears it in a simple braid to keep it out of his face.</p>
<p>Mortimer's eyes are his most striking feature - they are a piercing blue colour, bright and inquisitive. They seem to sparkle with a mischievous glint, hinting at the sly wit and wry humour that lies beneath his serious demeanour. Despite his width and lean build, Mortimer is deceptively tough.</p>
<p>Mortimer was born on the outskirts of the large city of Neverwinter, the only child of a poor family. From a young age, he displayed an aptitude for magic, but he never had much ambition. His parents struggled to provide for their family, and Mortimer was often left to his own devices. He spent much of his childhood wandering the woods and fields outside the city, practising magic in secret and dreaming of a better life.</p>
<p>When Mortimer was fifteen, he caught the eye of a wealthy merchant who was passing through the area. The merchant recognized Mortimer's potential and offered to sponsor his education at the magical academy in Neverwinter. Mortimer's parents were overjoyed at the opportunity, and Mortimer himself was excited to finally have a chance to develop his magical abilities.</p>
<p>Mortimer excelled at the academy, but he never quite fit in with the other students. He was quiet and reserved, and he spent most of his free time in the library, poring over ancient tomes and manuscripts. After graduating, he was offered a job as a scribe and librarian at the academy, and he accepted without hesitation.</p>
<p>For the next thirty years, Mortimer lived a quiet and uneventful life in Neverwinter. He spent his days cataloguing and organising the academy's vast collection of magical texts, and his nights practising his spells in the privacy of his own home. He never married or had children, and he rarely left the city except to visit his ageing parents on the outskirts.</p>
<p>One of Mortimer’s friends is a dwarf named Gundram Rockseeker, who works as a travelling merchant and occasionally brings rare tomes and spellbooks to store in the academy library. Mortimer and Gundram have been close since they met at the academy many years ago, and Mortimer values Gundram's expertise in matters of magic and lore.</p>
<p>Another of Mortimer's friends is Vanessa, a bard who frequents the academy to share stories and ideas for new texts to be stored in the library. Vanessa and Mortimer have a mutual respect for each other's craft, and Mortimer often finds himself inspired by her creative energy.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mortimer is also acquainted with Gundram's cousin Vaxidd, a paladin who occasionally visits the academy to research ancient holy texts. Although Mortimer and Vaxidd come from very different worlds, they share a deep reverence for knowledge and a desire to use their respective talents for the greater good.</p>
<p>However, everything changed when his old friend Gundram Rockseeker came to him with a request. He needed an escort to ensure the safety of the caravan transporting goods to the site, and he had thought of Mortimer and Vanessa as the perfect people for the job.</p>
<p>Now, at the age of 54, Mortimer has decided to venture out into the world and start adventuring. He feels that he has spent too much of his life cooped up in the academy, and he wants to use and improve his magical skills in a more exciting and fulfilling way. He knows that the road ahead will be dangerous and uncertain, but he is willing to take the risk in order to finally experience the world beyond the walls of Neverwinter.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a dark elf named Sheod who did not grow up in his native lands. His family had been murdered when he was just a baby, and his older sister managed to save him and flee to the Dark Forests. There, they lived for a few years, surviving by plundering the villages around the forest. However, a terrible encounter with an enraged beast left them vulnerable and exposed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a tribe of forest elves found and rescued them. They took Sheod and his sister under their wing, teaching them various skills like hunting, farming, fighting, arts, and the language of men. Sheod grew up participating in patrols and expeditions, which fueled his desire to discover more about the region.</p>
<p>Despite the protection of the forest elves, Sheod still had the habit of looting things in the surrounding villages. He did so in the hopes of finding clues about his family's murder and his origins. After spending many years with the elves, he decided to leave his sister behind and set out on a journey to uncover more information about his race.</p>
<p>Sheod now offers escort services, patrols, and exploration throughout the kingdom. His deepest goal is to avenge his family's death by finding and confronting their murderers. He is capable of abandoning any task if he feels it could lead to useful information.</p>
<p>During one mission as a scout for a group of Paladins protecting the lands of the Kingdom, Sheod allied with men and dwarves to prevent an invasion. His espionage work helped reveal the enemy's tactics, allowing the group to prepare and win the battle. Sheod's bow was given to him by the elves of his tribe, and he makes his arrows using his hatchet and dagger.</p>
<p>Although Sheod does not care much for money, he uses it to support himself and makes tips for his long-range arrows. His journey led him to discover relevant information about the Drow society in Umbreterna, where he found out that mass murders can have countless motives. He learned that on the day he fled, there was a command of execution for some families, which could hold the key to his family's murder.</p>

<p>Vaxidd Ironforger was born into the renowned Ironforger clan, known throughout the land for their exceptional blacksmithing skills and their unmatched prowess in battle. At the age of 200, Vaxidd had already gained a reputation as a seasoned warrior and a fierce protector of the innocent.</p>
<p>Years ago, Vaxidd's path crossed with that of his cousin, Gundram Rockseeker, a prominent merchant in Neverwinter, and Mortimer, a human scholar and librarian at the prestigious Neverwinter Academy. Gundram and Vaxidd were close, having grown up together, and they shared a passion for adventure and justice. Mortimer, with his extensive knowledge of the arcane, was a valuable asset to their group.</p>
<p>One day, Gundram came to Vaxidd, Mortimer, and three other adventurers. He needed an escort for his caravan of goods, which was travelling into a potentially dangerous area. He sought the aid of his trusted friends to ensure that the caravan would reach its destination safely.</p>
<p>Vaxidd, motivated by his sense of duty and his Paladin oath, could not refuse the call for help. He knew he could rely on his cousin and his friends' unique skills and abilities to overcome any challenge that lay ahead.</p>
