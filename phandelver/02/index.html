<h1 id="day-2">Day 2</h1>
<p>As the group continued their journey, the first day was uneventful. They made camp for the night and set off early in the morning, hoping to arrive in Phandalin by nightfall.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/02-ambush.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="ambush" src="../images/02-ambush.png" /></a></p>
<p>On the second day, as they came around a bend, they spotted two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of them, blocking the path. Each had several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods pressed close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side. The saddlebags had been looted. Nearby lay an empty leather map case.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard rustling in the bushes, and before they knew it, they were ambushed by a group of goblins! The goblins sprang from the woods, brandishing their weapons and screeching with rage.</p>
<p>Mortimer quickly scrambled for his spellbook, while Vaxidd charged forward with his warhammer. Sheod, the drow ranger, skillfully aimed his bow at one of the goblins and released an arrow, hitting it squarely in the chest. One of the goblins, fired an arrow at Mortimer, who took it in the arm, and rolled off the wagon, still clutching his spellbook.</p>
<p>Orianna, furious with the attack, began to sing a haunting melody, mocking viciously one of the goblins, who fell to the ground, writhing in pain. Mortimer used his telekinesis to throw the arrows from a goblin's quiver to the floor, confusing him. Vaxidd struck down another goblin with his warhammer, blood splattering his glimmering shield.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts, the goblins continued to attack. Sheod, calm and centered, fired arrows with precision, taking down another goblin. Mortimer swirled his fingers and flung his arm, casting a spell to put the last of the goblins to sleep. Vaxidd quickly tied up the sleeping goblin.</p>
<p>As the group took a moment to catch their breath, they discussed what to do next. They needed to know more about the goblins' intentions and who was behind the ambush.</p>
<p>"We need to interrogate this goblin and find out who sent them," Vaxidd said firmly. "Agreed," Mortimer nodded. "We need to know who's behind this."</p>
<p>Orianna approached the tied-up goblin and began to speak in a language the others didn't understand. The goblin looked up at her fearfully.</p>
<p>"What did you find out?" Sheod asked, impatiently.</p>
<p>"Their leader is a bugbear named Klarg," Orianna replied. "He answers to King Grol, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle. It's a long way due north"</p>
<p>"Klarg has told these goblins to ambush all travellers who pass through, and take all that they recover back to him to their hideout, a cave not far from here.</p>
<p>The group exchanged worried glances. "We need to find Gundren and make sure he's safe," Vaxidd said firmly. </p>
<p>Orianna turned to the goblin “You will show us this cave, and you will behave, and you will speak Common from now on”.</p>
<p>“Of Course, of course!” cowered the goblin “My name is Bobby the goblin, I will lead you to the trail to the cave where we are guarding the loot”</p>
<p>With Bob as their guide, the group sets off towards the cave, unsure of what they will find or what dangers they will face.</p>
<h2 id="into-the-cave">Into the cave</h2>
<p>As the group follows the goblin, they keep their eyes peeled for any sign of danger. Orianna grips her lute tightly, ready to use it as a weapon if necessary. Sheod leads the way, his bow at the ready, scanning the trees for any sign of movement.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/02-cave.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="cave" src="../images/02-cave.png" /></a></p>
<p>After about 15 minutes of tense walking, they arrive at the entrance of a cave. Sheod takes the lead, his keen ranger senses on full alert. As they approach the entrance, a putrid smell hits their nostrils. It's the stench of animals, and it's overwhelming.</p>
<p>As they enter the cave, they come upon a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end. But it's what's in between that catches their attention: three wolves, chained up and snarling ferociously.</p>
<p>The group approaches the wolves with caution. They can see the chains are secured to iron rods driven into the base of stalagmites. Orianna tries to calm the wolves with a soft melody on her lute, but it seems to have no effect. As they pass by, the wolves start pulling at their chains, trying to get free.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Sheod hears a loud snap, and the chains go slack. The wolves are loose! They lunge forward, snarling and baring their teeth. The group backs away, weapons at the ready, but the wolves are more interested in fleeing the cave than attacking them.</p>
<p>As the wolves disappear into the darkness, Mortimer steps forward, conjuring his small owl familiar to scout deeper into the cave. The owl flits off, clumsily navigating the cavern until it reaches a large chamber.</p>
<p>Through the owl's eyes, Mortimer sees a massive figure, twice the size of a normal human, wielding a menacing club. The figure spots the owl and with a quick swipe of his club, he kills it instantly. As the owl dissipates into the ether, Mortimer can still hear the figure mutter “Damn these things always flying in”, leaving Mortimer shaken.</p>
<p>Mortimer turns to the others, "There's someone big in there. And they're not friendly." They take a moment to regroup and plan their next move. They know they need to proceed with caution.</p>
<p>Sheod, Orianna, and Bobby carefully make their way through the side passage, their weapons drawn and ready. As they enter the large cave, they hear the sounds of goblins chattering and cooking over an open fire. The smell of smoke and unwashed goblins makes their eyes water.</p>
<p>They quickly spot Sildar, bound and unconscious on the southern ledge of the cavern. Sheod signals to the others to approach quietly. They cautiously make their way up the steep natural staircase to the upper ledge, trying not to make any noise.</p>
<p>As they reach the top, the goblin leader, Puglik, spots them and grabs Sildar, holding him tightly at the edge of the ledge. "Truce, or this human dies!" he threatens.</p>
<p>The adventurers exchange a worried glance, unsure of how to proceed. They can't risk Sildar's life, but they also can't let the goblins go unpunished. Puglik speaks up, trying to convince them to help him overthrow Klarg and become the new boss.</p>
<p>"Kill Klarg and bring me his head, and I'll release this human," Puglik promises.</p>
<p>Sheod steps forward, keeping his voice steady. "How do we know you'll keep your word?"</p>
<p>Puglik sneers. "You don't, but it's your best chance to get out of here alive."</p>
<p>Sheod nods, thinking quickly. "We'll need a plan. Can you tell us anything about Klarg's weaknesses?"</p>
<p>Puglik hesitates for a moment, then speaks. "Klarg is a powerful bugbear, but he's not too bright. He likes to show off his strength and intimidate his minions. If you can get him alone, he'll be an easy target."</p>
<p>Back in the main entrance, Vaxidd has no trouble seeing in the dark, a boon from his dwarven heritage, but Mortimer is blind. The atmosphere is tense, with the sound of dripping water echoing throughout the cavern. With a wave of his hand, Vaxidd’s helms begins to glow his helmet illuminating the path ahead. Mortimer, towering over Vaxidd, follows closely behind </p>
<p>Vaxidd grumbles, "This is ridiculous. I look like a walking lamp." </p>
<p>Mortimer chuckles, "Better a walking lamp than a blind one." </p>
<p>“At least make my shield glow instead, else I’ll kill the goblins with laughter” replies Vaxidd.</p>
<p>Mortimer flicks his finger in the air and the glow passes from his helmet to his shield.</p>
<p>As they approach a large chamber, the sound of rushing water grows louder. They can see a makeshift dam, constructed by the goblins to stop the water from flooding the main entrance. Vaxidd spots two goblins standing guard, looking nervous as they sense danger approaching.</p>
<p>Mortimer quickly conjures an illusion in the shape of a large, immobile black bear behind the goblins. He cups his hands and roars, the roar appearing to come form the bear itself, sending one of the goblins fleeing in fear. The other goblin, however, runs straight into Vaxidd, who wastes no time and brings down his warhammer upon the creature's skull with a sickening crunch, sending bone and brain matter splattering in all directions.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the massive bugbear, Klarg, jumps out from an opening, swinging his club at the illusion of the bear, his pet dire wolf by his side. For a moment, Klarg freezes, disbelieving his eyes, trying to hit the illusion again, but it's like trying to grasp smoke. Klarg's confusion and frustration grow with every missed swing.</p>
<p>Sheod and Orianna, who had been exploring the cave ahead of Vaxidd and Mortimer, arrive to join the fray. Orianna begins by hurling insults at Klarg, calling him names that question his strength and masculinity, and mocking his appearance and intelligence. She then weaves subtle enchantments into her words, amplifying their effect and causing Klarg to become confused and disoriented. The insults, combined with the enchantments, strike at Klarg's confidence and resolve, making him feel vulnerable and unsure of himself. As a result, his attacks become slower and heavy with doubt.</p>
<p>Sheod takes aim with his bow and shoots an arrow between Klarg's eyes. The arrow tip skewers his skull, as blood spatters across the floor and Klarg falls dead to the ground, his face still in confusion with all the events leading to his demise.</p>
<p>As the dire wolf charges towards Vaxidd, its eyes glowing with fury, Vaxidd can feel his heart racing in his chest. He braces himself and readies his warhammer, feeling the weight of it in his hands. "Looks like this pup wants a piece of me," he says, a sly grin spreading across his face.</p>
<p>The wolf lunges forward, teeth bared, and Vaxidd swings his hammer with all his might. The impact is bone-crushing, and the wolf lets out a final, blood-curdling yelp before collapsing to the ground in a lifeless heap. Vaxidd takes a moment to catch his breath, his shield still glowing faintly.</p>
<p>After the battle, Sheod wipes the blood off his blade and swiftly decapitates Klarg, holding up the grisly trophy as proof of their success. Orianna nods approvingly, but her eyes betray a hint of sadness for the life that was taken.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mortimer and Vaxidd scavenge the goblins' bodies and Klarg's corpse for loot. Mortimer's eyes light up at the sight of the potions and spell scrolls, while Vaxidd grumbles about the lack of real treasure. They also find a crate marked with the image of a blue lion — the symbol of the Lionshield, a merchant company with a warehouse and trading post in Phandalin. Vaxidd takes it without effort.</p>
<p>As Sheod and Orianna present Klarg's head to Puglik, the situation takes a turn for the worse. Puglik snatches Sildar and holds a knife to his throat, demanding more gold. Sheod's hands grip his bow, ready to shoot, but Orianna places a calming hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Please, Puglik," she pleads. "We fulfilled our end of the bargain. Let Sildar go."</p>
<p>Puglik's eyes narrow. "Not until I get what's mine."</p>
<p>Mortimer steps forward, holding out a pouch of gold. "Here, take it all. Just let Sildar go unharmed."</p>
<p>Sheod rolls his eyes at Mortimer's statement, but his annoyance quickly fades as he watches the wizard's hand dip into his pouch. Mortimer's fingers emerge, clutching a handful of sparkling sand, which he flicks towards Puglik's face.</p>
<p>The goblin leader sputters and gasps as the sand hits him, before collapsing in a heap on the ground. Sheod stares in disbelief at the sleeping goblin, realizing that the sand was no ordinary dust.</p>
<p>"By Moradin's beard," Vaxidd exclaims, "that was a sleep spell! Where did you learn that, Mortimer?"</p>
<p>Mortimer shrugs, "Just a little trick I picked up in my travels."</p>
<p>The other goblins freeze, unsure of what to do now that their leader has fallen.</p>
<p>Vaxidd steps forward, a fierce glint in his eyes. "We're taking Sildar and leaving. If any of you try to stop us, you'll end up like your boss."</p>
<p>The goblins shrink back in fear as Sheod and Vaxidd carry Sildar's unconscious form out of the cave. As they emerge into the bright sunlight, the weight of their victory settles over them. Orianna can't help but feel a twinge of guilt for the violence they've wrought. Sheod, on the other hand, feels a surge of pride for protecting their friend and fulfilling their mission. Mortimer is already pouring over the spell scrolls, eager to learn new magic. And Vaxidd is still muttering about the lack of treasure.</p>
<h2 id="trip-to-phandalin">Trip to Phandalin</h2>
<p>As the group emerged from the cave, they found themselves in a small clearing. Vaxidd, with a look of concentration on his face, knelt down beside Sildar and laid his hands on the wounded man, invoking his Paladin's powers to heal Sildar's wounds.</p>
<p>As Sildar regained consciousness, he looked up at the party with gratitude in his eyes. "Thank you," he said, his voice weak but sincere. "I don't know how I can repay you for saving my life."</p>
<p>Sheod stepped forward, his bow at his side. "Don't worry about it," he said, a smirk playing across his face. "We're always happy to help someone in need."</p>
<p>Sildar nodded gratefully, then his expression turned serious. "I'm anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible," he said. "I have urgent business there."</p>
<p>Vaxidd nodded. "Of course," he said. "We'll help you get there safely."</p>
<p>As they walked towards their ox cart, Sildar shared what he knew about Gundren's disappearance. "Gundren had a map," he said. "But the goblins took it when they captured him. Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, was given specific orders to ambush and capture Gundren. The Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought in."</p>
<p>"I hate spiders," Mortimer mutters, shuddering.</p>
<p>Sheod's eyes widened at the mention of the Black Spider. "Do you know who or what the Black Spider is?" he asked.</p>
<p>Sildar shook his head. "I'm afraid I don't," he said. "But I heard from the goblins that he's the one who's behind all of this."</p>
<p>The group exchanged worried glances, but Vaxidd spoke up, his voice firm. "We'll figure this out," he said. "And we'll make sure that Gundren is safe."</p>
<p>With that, the group climbed onto the ox cart and set off towards Phandalin, determined to uncover the truth about the Black Spider and Gundren's disappearance.</p>
<h2 id="passing-the-time">Passing the time</h2>
<p>Mortimer turned to Vaxidd with a sheepish look on his face. "I owe you an apology, my dear friend. I used you as a decoy in that cave, and I'm sorry for that," he said.</p>
<p>Vaxidd let out a loud belly laugh. "Oh, don't worry, my dear wizard. It was quite the thrilling experience. I always enjoy being the bait for goblins," he said with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>Mortimer raised an eyebrow. "Well, that's not quite what I meant. You see, I'm useless in the dark without my familiar. I was going to make my hat glow, but I didn't want to give away our position."</p>
<p>Vaxidd burst out laughing. "Ah, I see! Well, I suppose I should be flattered to be your designated bait. But don't worry, my friend. You've only helped me fulfill one of my missions: to protect those in need."</p>
<p>Mortimer chuckled. "I guess that means I owe you one. Or maybe two, considering how well you handled those goblins."</p>
<p>Mortimer then turned to Orianna and said, "I know you can put yourself in anyone's good graces, but goblins don't have enough intelligence to understand the concept of friendship. Most only understand food and violence, so I'm not surprised that Bob was left behind in the cave."</p>
<p>Orianna smiled slyly, "Mortimer, I know goblins are not intelligent, but I thought you knew how much I like to make new friends even if they have fewer brains."</p>
<p>Sheod grumbled, "By the gods, why couldn't they make me deaf during the day instead of blind? All this kindness and fresh air is making my head spin. I'll walk with the ox as he doesn't speak much. The only reliefe is that at teh end fo this I'll earn me some coin...."</p>
<p>Mortimer muttered under his breath, "Geez, what a grouch." Then he turned to Sheod and said, "Hey Sheod, I have a challenge for you."</p>
<p>Sheod raised an eyebrow, "And what would that be?"</p>
<p>Mortimer snapped his fingers and three gold coins floated out of his pouch, hovering in the air at different distances. "You have three shots. Every coin you hit with your bow is yours. Every time you miss, you pay me one. How about that?"</p>
<p>Sheod smirked, "Hmph, even after turning that Bugbear into a unicorn, you still doubt my aim? I'll make you a more interesting proposal. When we stop, toss the coin as high as you can. If I hit it, you give me free access to the library's entire collection, and you also reserve for me all the information you can get that has to do with the Umbreterna... I don't want your gold, I'm looking for something more...rare."</p>
<p>Mortimer grinned, "I don't doubt your aim, but it's to see if it was luck or not. Come on, it helps pass the time. And don't worry, I'm happy to give you whatever I can tell you about Umbreterna. By the way, in the Common tongue it is called The Underdark."</p>
<p>Sheod took aim and shot an arrow, hitting the nearest coin with a loud ding.</p>
<p>Mortimer clapped, "Bravo! One coin you've already won. Do you still want to try your luck on the others?" The coins began to levitate and move away.</p>
<p>"Keep them, Mage. As proof of being one of the few I enjoy the company of. Except for the moments of exaggerated tenderness. I'm going to check the horizon to see how far away we still are." Sheod smirked, reluctantly allowing himself to relax and smile in acceptance of the group.</p>
<h2 id="arriving-at-phandalin">Arriving at Phandalin</h2>
<p>As the sun sets, casting its warm golden glow over the horizon, our intrepid adventurers finally arrive at the fabled city of Phandalin.</p>
<p>Phandalin, a place steeped in both history and tragedy, stands proudly on the remnants of a once-thriving settlement. Long ago, the town flourished in harmony with the dwarves and gnomes of the legendary Phandelver's Pact. Alas, the ravages of a savage orc horde reduced Phandalin to ruins, leaving it abandoned for countless years.</p>
<p>However, hope and determination have breathed new life into this forgotten place. Over the past few years, brave settlers from the bustling cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have dared to reclaim the shattered remains of Phandalin. What was once desolate now teems with life as farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and fortune seekers have flocked to these lands, enticed by rumors of untold riches hidden within the foothills of the formidable Sword Mountains. Yet, amidst this renaissance, a dark cloud looms. A notorious gang known as the Redbrands has seized control of Phandalin, inflicting fear and oppression upon its inhabitants. The shadowy figure leading the gang, known as Glasstaff, remains a mystery, haunting the dreams of the townsfolk.</p>
<p>As the weary travelers continue their journey, the rutted track emerges from the dense woodland, unveiling the first glimpse of Phandalin. The town stands defiantly, its simple log structures mingling with ancient fieldstone foundations. Ruins, once proud stone walls, now succumb to the relentless embrace of ivy and thorny briars, poignant reminders of a grandeur long past. The juxtaposition of old and new whispers tales of a bygone era when Phandalin thrived as a bustling hub of activity. The main road, which was once a mere cart track, now stretches before them, morphing into a muddy artery that winds its way towards a dilapidated manor house perched upon a hill on the eastern fringes of town.</p>
<p>Approaching closer, the sight unfolds like a vivid tapestry. Laughter and playful shouts fill the air as children revel in the freedom of the town green. Townsfolk diligently attend to their daily chores, scurrying about the shops and market stalls, their faces a tapestry of determination and resilience. Inquisitive gazes turn towards the approaching adventurers, momentarily piqued by the unfamiliar arrivals, before returning to the pressing demands of their own lives.</p>
<p>Sildar, still recovering from his ordeal, could feel his muscles relaxing as the goblins became a distant memory. "My friends," he said with a relieved smile, "let us seek rest. I'm told the Twilight Refuge is a charming place to stay".</p>
<p>Orianna hesitated as Sildar suggested they secure lodgings at the Twilight Refuge. Her heart raced with mixed emotions at the mere thought of seeing her parents again after two decades of estrangement. She knew that the inn was owned and operated by her parents, and the thought of facing them again made her feel both anxious and nostalgic.</p>
<p>Mortimer, the old wizard, noticed Orianna's unease and placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Are you alright, my dear?" he asked with genuine concern. Orianna took a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves. "I'm fine," she replied, but her trembling voice betrayed her anxiety. "It's just that...the inn is run by my parents. I haven't seen them in a very long time."</p>
<p>The rest of the group looked at Orianna with understanding, and Vaxidd nodded sympathetically. "I see," he said. "It must be difficult for you. But perhaps it's time to face your past and make amends with your family."</p>
<p>"Agreed." said Mortimer "But maybe let's drop off our cargo at the Lionshield place first". Orianna sighed with relief, but was still tense in anxiety of seeing her parents again. The group made their way to the Lionshield building, a modest trading post owned by a wealthy merchant company from Yartar. As they entered, they were greeted by Linene, the sharp-tongued master of the trading post. Her piercing eyes scanned each of the adventurers, lingering on Orianna.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the Phandalin post," Linene said, her voice businesslike. "I'm Linene, the master of this trading post. What brings you here?"</p>
<p>"We have recovered some stolen goods from the goblins," Mortimer spoke up. "And we were hoping to return them to their rightful owner."</p>
<p>Linene inspected the goods carefully, relieved to see they were from the Lionshield caravan. "We though these were lost forever! Where did you find them?".</p>
<p>"A bugbear and a group of goblins were jumping every caravan that would pass the road from here to Neverwinter" recounted Mortimer, while lighting his pipe "We had to part them from this cargo as well as their heads...". "These will help a lot of people here in Phandalin" Linene said ", as well as keep my business afloat. Let me repay you for your troubles". She reached into a nearby drawer and drew a hefty bag, which she gave each traveller 50 gold pieces from.</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Sheod said. "But we were just doing what any honorable person would do."</p>
<p>Linene nodded, studying each adventurer. "I appreciate your honesty and bravery," she said. "But be warned, this town has its share of troublemakers. I wouldn't trust just anyone here."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Sheod asked.</p>
<p>"The Redbrands," Linene replied, her voice dropping to a whisper. "They're a group of ruffians who have been causing a lot of trouble around here. I won't do business with them, and I suggest you avoid them as well. They're nothing but trouble."</p>
<p>As the group left the trading post, Orianna's nerves began to escalate. "I don't know if I can do this," she admitted to the group. "It's been so long, and I don't know what to say to them." Mortimer patted her back. "You'll find the words," he reassured her. "Just be yourself."</p>
<p>The Twilight Refuge was a quaint, two-story building with a thatched roof and a sign bearing its name swinging in the breeze. As they approached, Orianna could see her father through the window, bustling about inside. Her heart leaped into her throat, and she hesitated.</p>
<p>"Go on," Vaxidd urged. "We'll be right here with you."</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Orianna pushed open the door and stepped inside. The sound of laughter and conversation filled her ears as she scanned the room for her parents. Her eyes landed on a pair of figures sitting by the fireplace, and she froze.</p>
<p>"Dad?" she whispered, her voice barely audible.</p>
<p>Her father turned, and his eyes widened in shock. "Orianna?" his father gasped.</p>
<p>After a moment of stunned silence, Orianna's father rushed to embrace her. "We thought we'd lost you forever," her father said, his voice choked with emotion. He was a large individual, tall in size and with a big round belly. He had an apron, dirty from his chores, thick arms from manual labour and his knuckles were bruised.</p>
<p>"I've missed you so much. Where is mom?" said Orianna, now relieved from receiving a large embrace from her father. He replied his gaze sobering "Ah, we sent her to Leilon, along with two of your brothers. It wasn't as safe as we wanted here, what with the Redbrands harassing us all the time. We decided best that she go there for a while and come back once things are more calm." he then noticed the group that came in behind Oriana, the armoured dwarf, the somber drow, and the aged wizard.</p>
<p>"These are my friends," Orianna announced proudly, gesturing towards Sheod, Vaxidd and Mortimer. "We've been together since Neverwinter." Her father shifted his attention towards the group, wiping his hands on his apron. "I don't have enough rooms for each of you," he admitted. "But the ones I have are quite ample. If you don't mind sharing, you're welcome to stay and rest."</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Vaxidd tossed a gold coin onto the counter and exclaimed, "A flagon of your finest ale, innkeep!" Meanwhile, Mortimer made his way to a nearby table, the chair sliding out on its own to allow him to sit. With a snap of his fingers, the hearth blazed to life, illuminating the tavern with a warm glow. Sliding a coin across the counter, Sheod grabbed a turkey drumstick and a bottle before making his way upstairs. Exhausted from the journey, all he wanted was to rest. As he settled into the bedroom and the day began to wind down, Sheod caught a glimpse of a dark figure perched on one of the rooftops. The figure gazed back at him before vanishing, leaving Sheod uncertain if it had even been there at all.</p>
<p>Sheod dashed down the stairs and back to Orianna's father, who had been preparing some food. "Sir, what can you tell us about the Redbrands?" Sheod asked.</p>
<p>Orianna's father looked up and his expression became solemn. "The Redbrands have been causing a lot of trouble in town lately. They steal from the people and bully them. Nobody knows who they are or what they want, but they've been causing a lot of fear and tension."</p>
<p>Sheod's friends, Vaxidd and Mortimer, joined him at the counter. "What can we do to stop them?" Vaxidd asked.</p>
<p>"Well, the Redbrands have been seen hanging out at the Sleeping Giant Inn up the road," Orianna's father said. "If you want to investigate further, that's a good place to start. But be careful, they're not to be underestimated."</p>
<p>Mortimer cracked his knuckles. "Sounds like it's time to teach those Redbrands a lesson," he said, a wicked grin on his face.</p>
<p>Sheod raised an eyebrow at Mortimer's enthusiasm but nodded in agreement. "We'll need a plan," he said. "What else can you tell us about them?"</p>
<p>Orianna's father thought for a moment. "There's a mansion at the edge of town where they're known to gather. It's heavily guarded, though. If you're going to take them on, you'll need to be well-prepared."</p>
<p>Sheod and his friends exchanged determined looks. "We won't let them terrorize this town any longer," Sheod said. "Thank you for your help, sir. I'll be back." and he dashed out the door.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sheod stumbled up the dimly lit street, making sure to keep his hood low over his face. As he rounded the corner towards the Sleeping Giant Inn, he spotted two Redbrands loitering outside. He slowed his pace, trying to look as drunk as possible, and approached them with a lopsided grin.</p>
<p>"Hey, fellas," Sheod slurred. "You guys look like you're havin' a good time. Mind if I join in?"</p>
<p>The Redbrands exchanged a look of annoyance before turning back to Sheod. "Beat it, drunk," one of them growled.</p>
<p>Sheod feigned offense, swaying back and forth. "C'mon, guys. I just wanna have a drink and chat with some friendly faces."</p>
<p>The other Redbrand snorted. "We're not here to make friends, idiot. Now go away before we make you."</p>
<p>Sheod's fingers tightened around the bottle in his hand, his mind racing. He knew he needed to distract them somehow. Without warning, he hurled the bottle at the ruffians, but it sailed wide and smashed against the wall.</p>
<p>The Redbrands drew their swords, their faces twisted in anger. "That was a mistake, pal," one of them spat.</p>
<p>Sheod stumbled backwards, his hands up in surrender. "Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean it. I'll just go away now."</p>
<p>The Redbrands watched him retreat up the road, their eyes narrowed. Sheod's heart pounded in his chest, relieved to be out of their sight.</p>
<p>As the night wore on, the patrons of the Twilight Refuge Inn turned in one by one, the sounds of snoring and the crackling fire filling the air. Sheod lay in his bed, his mind racing with thoughts of the Redbrands and their nefarious activities. He knew he needed to find out more. Orianna, her heart relieved from seeing her father again. Vaxidd with a full belly of ale, bread, cheese and meat. And Mortimer, fast asleep, snoring loudly and occasionally letting out a muffled snort.</p>
