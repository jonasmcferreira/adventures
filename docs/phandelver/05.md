# Day 6

## Heavy Hearts

With time left before dawn, the adventurers decided to pay another visit to the local store. Their recent successes had garnered more than just appreciation â€“ they now had access to a selection of higher-quality items and even a few magical trinkets. Among the potions on display, a peculiar sight caught their attention. Amidst the assortment of stamina potions was a single vial, labeled with the emblem of radiant energy. The oddity piqued their curiosity, leaving them to wonder about its origin and purpose.

As they navigated through the store, inspecting the treasures that glittered within glass cases, the realization of their impact settled upon them. Their choices had reverberated throughout Phandalin, altering the lives of its residents and even the future of the village itself. The adventures of the past days had sculpted not only their own journey but the destiny of those they had crossed paths with. And as they prepared for what lay ahead, they couldn't help but reflect on the weight of their role as both heroes and unwitting agents of change.
