# Day 7

## Old "friends"

The following morning, the champions found themselves once again in the forest where they had first encountered the goblins. Underbrush crunched beneath their boots, birdsong filled the air, and sunlight broke through the canopy in dappled patterns. Yet, a sense of foreboding loomed over them, as if the woods themselves were wary of their quest.

The champions set out from Phandalin, armor glistening in the dappled sunlight that filtered through the trees. Orianna's lute was safely slung over her back, and the enchantments on Mortimer's staff hummed quietly as they trudged through the forest. Their mission was as clear as the mid-morning sky: find Bob the Goblin, in hopes he might help guide them to Cragmaw Castle.

Just as the champions neared the place they had been first ambushed weeks prior, they heard rustling in the bushes followed by an abrupt "Psst!" Out popped Bob the Goblin, brandishing a small stick as if it were a mighty weapon.

"Ah! It's you again!" he exclaimed, pointing the stick at Orianna. "You're that devil who told us to be friendly!"

Orianna chuckled, strumming a light note on her lute. "Indeed, and it seems you've taken my advice to heart. What's with the stick?"

Bob grinned, lowering his makeshift weapon. "This is friendly raiding stick. No sharp, no hurt, just bonk!"

Mortimer smirked. "Friendly raiding, you say? Well, that's a novel approach."

Bob scratched his head, appearing slightly confused yet eager to please. "Um, yes! We bonk travelers, then ask for, um, 'donation.' All friendly-like!"

Vaxidd leaned on his mighty shield and sighed. "Oh, the creativity of goblins never ceases to amaze me. But we aren't here for a 'friendly raid.' We seek information."

Bob's eyes narrowed cautiously. "What kind?"

"We need to find Cragmaw Castle," Orianna said gently. "Do you know the way?"

Bob hesitated, his eyes darting from one champion to the next. Finally, he sighed. "Fine, you were good to Bob and his mates. I show you, but be careful. Castle dangerous place."

Sheod, who had been silently nocking an arrow in case things went south, eased the bowstring and nodded. "Lead the way, then."

Bob turned and scurried through the forest, leading the champions over uneven terrain and through snaking vines. Their footsteps were hushed whispers against the forest floor, as if even the Earth itself sensed the gravity of their mission. Finally, they came upon a hill that offered a panoramic view of the forest. Bob pointed a trembling finger towards a distant, crumbling tower peeking above the treeline.

"Cragmaw Castle there," he whispered, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "You go, you careful. You no die, you tell Bob. Bob want know."

Orianna strummed a series of chords on her lute, producing a melody that seemed to fill the air with a sense of resolve and determination. "We'll do our best, Bob. And we'll come back to tell the tale."

Bob grinned, seemingly relieved. "Good. Bob wait."

And with that, the goblin disappeared into the foliage as abruptly as he had arrived. The champions exchanged glances. The next stage of their journey was set, and as they looked toward the distant ruin that was Cragmaw Castle, each felt a mingling of anticipation and dread. But whatever awaited them—danger, traps, or answers—it was a path they would walk together.

As the champions stood poised to move toward Cragmaw Castle, Bob the Goblin hesitated. A thoughtful, or as thoughtful as a goblin can look, expression crept onto his face. "Wait, wait! Before castle, I show you something else. A special place we found. Very powerful!"

"Special place?" Mortimer raised an eyebrow, his hand instinctively caressing the runes on his staff. "What exactly are you talking about, Bob?"

Bob's eyes darted around nervously, as if contemplating the wisdom of his decision. "Come, come! You see."

He led them deeper into the forest, the foliage growing denser with each step. The sunlight waned, replaced by an eerie glow filtering through the thick canopy of leaves. After about half an hour, they reached a secluded cave mouth, shrouded in darkness and enshrouded by towering ferns.

"Here," Bob said, pointing into the cavern. "Go look. You find good thing."

Mortimer lit the tip of his staff, illuminating the cave in an azure glow. As they stepped inside, their eyes fell upon an astonishing sight: A statue of a devil goddess, carved with an artistry that seemed far beyond the abilities of any goblin. She was depicted in a seductive pose, wings unfurled, and her eyes seemed to glint with malevolent intelligence.

"We call her 'Orianna's Mother'," Bob giggled, clearly misunderstanding the form of the deity.

Vaxidd stiffened, his warrior senses instantly repulsed by the dark energy emanating from the statue. "This is no place for us," he murmured, his voice tinged with distrust.

Mortimer, a well-studied mage with a penchant for the arcane, frowned as he examined the statue. "This appears to be Ashara, a lesser-known devil goddess from the lore of the Forgotten Realms. She offers power at a dangerous cost, tempting mortals into her dark covenant."

Orianna, who had been quiet thus far, strummed her lute softly. The strings vibrated in tune with the dark energy, and her eyes met those of the devil goddess. For a fleeting moment, it seemed as though the statue winked at her. The room felt thick with palpable magic, and the air buzzed with energy, as if the very molecules were bending to some unfathomable will.

Orianna felt an internal pull, a beckoning that tugged at her very essence. She felt a voice whisper promises of unfathomable power, of songs that could control minds and melodies that could shape reality. The temptation was incredible.

Vaxidd, attuned to the earth and faithful to Moradin, could sense the imbalance of the situation. "We should not be meddling with this, Orianna. The cost may be too great."

Sheod, arrow still nocked but relaxed, eyed the statue. "I don't need any gifts from something that requires a cavern as its home. Pass."

But Orianna, her fingers gently caressing her lute, made her decision. She nodded once, as if confirming a pact with the stone deity. The air seemed to crackle, the latent energy focusing into her being, infusing her with newfound strength. She could feel her songs and spells becoming more potent, more nuanced. She now had the power to manipulate more beings, to shift the balance of a room, a town, perhaps even the world.

Mortimer shook his head, muttering ancient proverbs under his breath about the dangers of meddling with gods, but Orianna felt a newfound confidence. This power could help them, could help her protect her friends and defeat their enemies.

As they exited the cave, each lost in their thoughts, Bob looked satisfied. "You like? Good, yes?"

They nodded, although each held a different opinion about what they'd just witnessed. As they resumed their journey towards Cragmaw Castle, Orianna couldn't help but strum her lute, delighting in the richer, fuller sound it now produced, her notes hanging in the air like enchanting fragrances. But amidst the beauty of her music was a new undertone, one of darker things and paths less tread. A complexity that mirrored the very journey they were on, one fraught with choices and consequences, a song of both light and shadow.

## Cragmaw castle

The sun cast long, eerie shadows over the ruins as the champions stood before the relic of a fortress known as Cragmaw Castle. Its jagged stones and crumbling towers were in stark contrast to the vibrant wilderness that surrounded it. Vines crept over its walls, and the elements had long since taken their toll on its grandeur. Mortimer considered the air of malevolence that seemed to permeate the very walls of the structure. This was a place where dark deeds had been committed, and where more awaited.

"We have two choices," Vaxidd announced, pointing to the north and south entrances. "Either we take the main entrance to the south or the one camouflaged to the north."

Mortimer, eyes narrowing, raised his staff. With a brief incantation, his owl familiar flew from its perch on his shoulder, soaring into the sky and circling over the castle. "Let's see what we're dealing with," he whispered, his consciousness melding with the owl's.

As the owl glided over the ruin, Mortimer saw through its eyes. Shadows darted and flickered within the castle's hollowed halls, but the details were elusive. There was the unmistakable sound of goblin chatter, along with the clinking and clattering of crockery. No guards patrolled the crumbling battlements, and no archers manned the slits in the walls. The castle's residents were oblivious to the approaching danger.

"Heads up," Mortimer returned to his senses and shared his findings. "The place is alive with activity, but their defenses are lax. They're not expecting visitors."

Sheod grinned, his fingers caressing the fletching of his arrows. "Then let's not disappoint them."

Orianna, feeling the power coursing through her from her new, otherworldly pact, strummed a chord on her lute, her fingertips glowing as she cast a spell of silence around them. They moved as shadows, their footsteps absorbed by the arcane quietude.

Choosing the camouflaged northern entrance seemed the wisest option, and so they did. With a flick of his wrist, Mortimer dispelled the illusion hiding the doorway. Vaxidd led, his shield raised and his eyes narrowed, wariness oozing from every pore. The adventurers tiptoed into the castle, senses heightened, nerves taut as bowstrings. Orianna's silent spell still shielded them, muffling their entrance and enveloping them in an impenetrable quiet.

Inside, the walls closed in like the belly of some great beast. The atmosphere was stifling, heavy with the scent of damp stone and ancient rot. Corridors snaked away into darkness, lit only by the occasional flicker of torchlight. Guttural voices echoed from some distant chamber, snippets of banter and the clatter of weaponry filling the air.

Vaxidd took a deep breath, gripping his sword hilt tightly. "So this is Cragmaw Castle. We must tread carefully; the maze of halls could easily become a trap."

The adventurers nodded, their eyes meeting in quiet agreement. They were in the heart of enemy territory, within walls that had witnessed countless atrocities and schemes. And yet, they moved onward, for they were bound by purpose, driven by a quest that was far from over.

Orianna, her fingers hovering over her lute strings, was ready. She felt the gaze of her new patron upon her, her newfound power a humming tension beneath her skin. Ahead lay danger, dark revelations, and, perhaps, the answers they had all been seeking.

With a silent nod from Vaxidd, they advanced deeper into the structure, unaware of the eyes that began to follow them from the shadowy corners. But whatever lay ahead, the champions of Phandalin were ready. Their journey into the darkness had just begun.
