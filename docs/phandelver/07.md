# Day 7

## Old "friends"

![](images/07-goblins.jpeg)

The following morning, the champions found themselves once again in the forest where they had first encountered the goblins. Underbrush crunched beneath their boots, birdsong filled the air, and sunlight broke through the canopy in dappled patterns. Yet, a sense of foreboding loomed over them, as if the woods themselves were wary of their quest.

The champions set out from Phandalin, armor glistening in the dappled sunlight that filtered through the trees. Orianna's lute was safely slung over her back, and the enchantments on Mortimer's staff hummed quietly as they trudged through the forest. Their mission was as clear as the mid-morning sky: find Bob the Goblin, in hopes he might help guide them to Cragmaw Castle.

Just as the champions neared the place they had been first ambushed weeks prior, they heard rustling in the bushes followed by an abrupt "Psst!" Out popped Bob the Goblin, brandishing a small stick as if it were a mighty weapon.

"Ah! It's you again!" he exclaimed, pointing the stick at Orianna. "You're that devil who told us to be friendly!"

Orianna chuckled, strumming a light note on her lute. "Indeed, and it seems you've taken my advice to heart. What's with the stick?"

Bob grinned, lowering his makeshift weapon. "This is friendly raiding stick. No sharp, no hurt, just bonk!"

Mortimer smirked. "Friendly raiding, you say? Well, that's a novel approach."

Bob scratched his head, appearing slightly confused yet eager to please. "Um, yes! We bonk travelers, then ask for, um, 'donation.' All friendly-like!"

Vaxidd leaned on his mighty shield and sighed. "Oh, the creativity of goblins never ceases to amaze me. But we aren't here for a 'friendly raid.' We seek information."

Bob's eyes narrowed cautiously. "What kind?"

"We need to find Cragmaw Castle," Orianna said gently. "Do you know the way?"

Bob hesitated, his eyes darting from one champion to the next. Finally, he sighed. "Fine, you were good to Bob and his mates. I show you, but be careful. Castle dangerous place."

Sheod, who had been silently nocking an arrow in case things went south, eased the bowstring and nodded. "Lead the way, then."

Bob turned and scurried through the forest, leading the champions over uneven terrain and through snaking vines. Their footsteps were hushed whispers against the forest floor, as if even the Earth itself sensed the gravity of their mission. Finally, they came upon a hill that offered a panoramic view of the forest. Bob pointed a trembling finger towards a distant, crumbling tower peeking above the treeline.

"Cragmaw Castle there," he whispered, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "You go, you careful. You no die, you tell Bob. Bob want know."

Orianna strummed a series of chords on her lute, producing a melody that seemed to fill the air with a sense of resolve and determination. "We'll do our best, Bob. And we'll come back to tell the tale."

Bob grinned, seemingly relieved. "Good. Bob wait."

And with that, the goblin disappeared into the foliage as abruptly as he had arrived. The champions exchanged glances. The next stage of their journey was set, and as they looked toward the distant ruin that was Cragmaw Castle, each felt a mingling of anticipation and dread. But whatever awaited them—danger, traps, or answers—it was a path they would walk together.

As the champions stood poised to move toward Cragmaw Castle, Bob the Goblin hesitated. A thoughtful, or as thoughtful as a goblin can look, expression crept onto his face. "Wait, wait! Before castle, I show you something else. A special place we found. Very powerful!"

"Special place?" Mortimer raised an eyebrow, his hand instinctively caressing the runes on his staff. "What exactly are you talking about, Bob?"

Bob's eyes darted around nervously, as if contemplating the wisdom of his decision. "Come, come! You see."

He led them deeper into the forest, the foliage growing denser with each step. The sunlight waned, replaced by an eerie glow filtering through the thick canopy of leaves. After about half an hour, they reached a secluded cave mouth, shrouded in darkness and enshrouded by towering ferns.

"Here," Bob said, pointing into the cavern. "Go look. You find good thing."

Mortimer lit the tip of his staff, illuminating the cave in an azure glow. As they stepped inside, their eyes fell upon an astonishing sight: A statue of a devil goddess, carved with an artistry that seemed far beyond the abilities of any goblin. She was depicted in a seductive pose, wings unfurled, and her eyes seemed to glint with malevolent intelligence.

"We call her 'Orianna's Mother'," Bob giggled, clearly misunderstanding the form of the deity.

Vaxidd stiffened, his warrior senses instantly repulsed by the dark energy emanating from the statue. "This is no place for us," he murmured, his voice tinged with distrust.

Mortimer, a well-studied mage with a penchant for the arcane, frowned as he examined the statue. "This appears to be Ashara, a lesser-known devil goddess from the lore of the Forgotten Realms. She offers power at a dangerous cost, tempting mortals into her dark covenant."

Orianna, who had been quiet thus far, strummed her lute softly. The strings vibrated in tune with the dark energy, and her eyes met those of the devil goddess. For a fleeting moment, it seemed as though the statue winked at her. The room felt thick with palpable magic, and the air buzzed with energy, as if the very molecules were bending to some unfathomable will.

Orianna felt an internal pull, a beckoning that tugged at her very essence. She felt a voice whisper promises of unfathomable power, of songs that could control minds and melodies that could shape reality. The temptation was incredible.

Vaxidd, attuned to the earth and faithful to Moradin, could sense the imbalance of the situation. "We should not be meddling with this, Orianna. The cost may be too great."

Sheod, arrow still nocked but relaxed, eyed the statue. "I don't need any gifts from something that requires a cavern as its home. Pass."

But Orianna, her fingers gently caressing her lute, made her decision. She nodded once, as if confirming a pact with the stone deity. The air seemed to crackle, the latent energy focusing into her being, infusing her with newfound strength. She could feel her songs and spells becoming more potent, more nuanced. She now had the power to manipulate more beings, to shift the balance of a room, a town, perhaps even the world.

Mortimer shook his head, muttering ancient proverbs under his breath about the dangers of meddling with gods, but Orianna felt a newfound confidence. This power could help them, could help her protect her friends and defeat their enemies.

As they exited the cave, each lost in their thoughts, Bob looked satisfied. "You like? Good, yes?"

They nodded, although each held a different opinion about what they'd just witnessed. As they resumed their journey towards Cragmaw Castle, Orianna couldn't help but strum her lute, delighting in the richer, fuller sound it now produced, her notes hanging in the air like enchanting fragrances. But amidst the beauty of her music was a new undertone, one of darker things and paths less tread. A complexity that mirrored the very journey they were on, one fraught with choices and consequences, a song of both light and shadow.

## Cragmaw castle

![](images/07-cragmaw.webp)

The sun cast long, eerie shadows over the ruins as the champions stood before the relic of a fortress known as Cragmaw Castle. Its jagged stones and crumbling towers were in stark contrast to the vibrant wilderness that surrounded it. Vines crept over its walls, and the elements had long since taken their toll on its grandeur. Mortimer considered the air of malevolence that seemed to permeate the very walls of the structure. This was a place where dark deeds had been committed, and where more awaited.

"We have two choices," Vaxidd announced, pointing to the north and south entrances. "Either we take the main entrance to the south or the one camouflaged to the north."

Mortimer, eyes narrowing, raised his staff. With a brief incantation, his owl familiar flew from its perch on his shoulder, soaring into the sky and circling over the castle. "Let's see what we're dealing with," he whispered, his consciousness melding with the owl's.

As the owl glided over the ruin, Mortimer saw through its eyes. Shadows darted and flickered within the castle's hollowed halls, but the details were elusive. There was the unmistakable sound of goblin chatter, along with the clinking and clattering of crockery. No guards patrolled the crumbling battlements, and no archers manned the slits in the walls. The castle's residents were oblivious to the approaching danger.

"Heads up," Mortimer returned to his senses and shared his findings. "The place is alive with activity, but their defenses are lax. They're not expecting visitors."

Sheod grinned, his fingers caressing the fletching of his arrows. "Then let's not disappoint them."

Orianna, feeling the power coursing through her from her new, otherworldly pact, strummed a chord on her lute, her fingertips glowing as she cast a spell of silence around them. They moved as shadows, their footsteps absorbed by the arcane quietude.

Choosing the camouflaged northern entrance seemed the wisest option, and so they did. With a flick of his wrist, Mortimer dispelled the illusion hiding the doorway. Vaxidd led, his shield raised and his eyes narrowed, wariness oozing from every pore. The adventurers tiptoed into the castle, senses heightened, nerves taut as bowstrings. Orianna's silent spell still shielded them, muffling their entrance and enveloping them in an impenetrable quiet.

Inside, the walls closed in like the belly of some great beast. The atmosphere was stifling, heavy with the scent of damp stone and ancient rot. Corridors snaked away into darkness, lit only by the occasional flicker of torchlight. Guttural voices echoed from some distant chamber, snippets of banter and the clatter of weaponry filling the air.

Vaxidd took a deep breath, gripping his sword hilt tightly. "So this is Cragmaw Castle. We must tread carefully; the maze of halls could easily become a trap."

The adventurers nodded, their eyes meeting in quiet agreement. They were in the heart of enemy territory, within walls that had witnessed countless atrocities and schemes. And yet, they moved onward, for they were bound by purpose, driven by a quest that was far from over.

Orianna, her fingers hovering over her lute strings, was ready. She felt the gaze of her new patron upon her, her newfound power a humming tension beneath her skin. Ahead lay danger, dark revelations, and, perhaps, the answers they had all been seeking.

With a silent nod from Vaxidd, they advanced deeper into the structure, unaware of the eyes that began to follow them from the shadowy corners. But whatever lay ahead, the champions of Phandalin were ready. Their journey into the darkness had just begun.

Vaxidd led the way, his armor a silent specter against the murk. They had barely taken a few steps into the decrepit hall when a sudden groan of ancient timber resounded through the eerie stillness. Before anyone could react, part of the ceiling gave way, sending chunks of stone and dust cascading down. Vaxidd threw up his shield, the rubble pelting off its surface with a series of thuds absorbed by the magical quietude.

Mortimer, standing safely out of the fall zone, allowed the hint of a smirk. "Watch your head, Vaxidd. The castle seems to be falling for you."

Vaxidd shook the debris from his shield, casting a wry glance at the mage. "Let's hope that's the only thing in here that does," he retorted, brushing off a cloud of dust.

Their moment of levity was short-lived as they cautiously approached the first doorway. With a collective breath, they readied themselves for whatever lay beyond. The door swung inward, revealing a chamber that chilled the blood in their veins.

Nezz, the drow they had encountered before, was there, her cold eyes flickering with malevolent glee. In her grasp was a wand, its nature and power indeterminate, but clearly of a dangerous provenance. Beside her loomed a bugbear, its size and ferocity dwarfing any they had seen before. They stood in the midst of an argument, the bugbear's low growls a bass counterpoint to Nezz's sibilant hisses.

The adventurers didn't hesitate. Battle stances were assumed with practiced ease. Orianna’s fingers danced across her lute, the air around her shimmering with the onset of a melody that sang of courage and dread. Sheod’s arrows notched silently, his eyes narrowing as he sought out his targets.

Vaxidd stepped forward, shield at the ready, the light glinting off his sword. "It seems we have unfinished business," he announced, the power of his voice breaking through the silent spell with command and intent.

Nezz sneered, her gaze locked onto the warriors before her. "Indeed, it is a pity you won't live to regret this intrusion," she hissed, her grip tightening on the wand.

Mortimer raised his staff, arcane power coalescing at its tip. "I'd say it's you who should be full of regrets," he quipped, the air crackling with his impending spell.

With no words left to waste, the tension snapped like a bowstring. Combat erupted, the champions of Phandalin moving as one against the darkness that sought to overwhelm them. This was their moment, a fight not just for survival, but for the very soul of the land they had sworn to protect.

Electric tension charged the air as Nezz brandished her wand, a malevolent chant spilling from her lips. A bolt of lightning surged forth, a blinding arc of raw energy that hungered for its targets. Vaxidd, Mortimer, and Orianna were caught in its wrathful path; their bodies seized by the cruel voltage, muscles contracting, cries stifled by the thunderous crack that followed.

Through the chaos, Sheod moved like a shadow. He dodged the deadly streak with a grace born of countless hours in the wild, his response a swift arrow released from taut string. It sailed, a thin promise of vengeance, and struck Nezz. A mere graze upon her flesh, it was an irritant rather than a wound, yet it earned a hiss of pain and surprise from the dark rogue.

Mortimer, shaking off the singeing pain, focused his wrath into a spell. His voice rose above the din, a litany of incantation that culminated in a volley of arcane darts. The magic missiles streaked across the room, a constellation of destructive intent that hammered into Nezz with unerring precision.

Orianna, the melody of battle upon her lips, summoned her own brand of retribution. The Dissonant Whispers wove through the air, a symphony of psychic torment that sought the drow’s mind. Nezz clutched at her temples, her face twisted in agony as the dissonance clawed at her sanity.

All the while, Vaxidd engaged King Grol in a deadly dance. He pressed the bugbear back, shield and sword a barrier between the monstrous brute and his vulnerable comrades. His every move was a statement, his every block a declaration that this beast would not pass.

In a corner, barely discernible beneath the shadow of battle, lay Gundren Rockseeker. The dwarf was bound and unconscious, oblivious to the violence that sought to claim his fate.

Nezz, rage contorting her features, raised the wand again, whispering dark promises to the twisted magic within. But fate is fickle, and as she unleashed her spell, it sputtered and died, a damp squib of power that left her snarling in frustration.

"You should've chosen a more reliable tool," Mortimer jeered, the taste of victory sweet upon his tongue.

"Your magic is as weak as your resolve," Orianna added, her voice ringing clear, the power of her song undiminished despite the lightning’s kiss.

Vaxidd saw the moment, the brief falter in Nezz's stance, the opening he had been waiting for. "Your time is up, Nezz. The light always finds a way," he declared, his voice a stalwart rumble as he tightened his grip, ready to end the standoff with King Grol and turn the tide of battle.

A sudden, surreal twist engulfed the chamber as Nezz's slender fingers conjured yet another enchantment from her enigmatic wand. In an instant, the room filled with a kaleidoscope of iridescent butterflies, their ephemeral wings a hypnotic dance that obscured vision and played tricks on the senses.

King Grol and Vaxidd, the blind combatants, swayed and weaved in a chaotic waltz, their strikes mere shadows in the dazzling whirl of colors. The bugbear's growls and the paladin's grunts of effort painted an odd symphony amidst the surreal, fluttering landscape.

Orianna, ever attuned to the ebb and flow of magic, felt the disturbance ripple through the room. She knew there was but one way to pierce this fanciful façade. With a resounding crescendo of sound that seemed to drown out even the chaotic butterflies, she cast Thunderclap. The concussive force blasted through the room, a shockwave of sound that struck with divine fury. The butterflies around her fell silent, their delicate forms shattered into a cascade of shimmering motes, revealing Nezz standing amidst the swirling chaos.

Sheod, seizing the opportunity, drew his bowstring taut, his true arrow seeking its mark. Mortimer, never one to be outdone, focused his magic into a trio of scorching rays, the fiery lances of power streaming toward the drow rogue.

In that suspended moment of clarity, Nezz's dark eyes widened, her lips parting in futile protest. The arrows and rays struck true, and a symphony of agony echoed in her final breath. Her form crumpled to the ground, the butterflies fading into oblivion as life slipped away.

"Looks like her magic wasn't enough to save her this time," Mortimer remarked with a smirk.

Sheod gave a nod of approval. "A fitting end for a rogue like her."

Vaxidd, breathing heavily, turned to King Grol, who stood alone amidst the dissipating swarm of butterflies. "Your move, bugbear." With a sudden, desperate lunge, he launched himself at Vaxidd, his eyes filled with a vengeful fire. The paladin's reflexes, honed by countless battles and a steadfast commitment to his companions, kicked in without hesitation.

With a swift and mighty swing, Vaxidd's warhammer found its mark, crashing into King Grol's chest with bone-crushing force. The bugbear's defiant charge was abruptly halted as he crumbled to the ground, his life extinguished in an instant.

The chamber was filled with the aftermath of violence, the echoes of betrayal still ringing in the air. Vaxidd, his warhammer poised and dripping with the remnants of his enemy, cast a solemn glance over the fallen bugbear. "Such is the fate of those who choose the path of treachery."

The party, their collective breaths held in shock, exchanged glances of disbelief and determination. The dangers that lurked within Cragmaw Castle had tested them in ways they could never have foreseen, but they stood undaunted, their bond forged in the crucible of their trials.

With Nezz and King Grol now vanquished, they were one step closer to unraveling the mysteries that had led them to this point. But the heart of their journey still lay ahead, and the challenges awaiting them in the shadows of Cragmaw Castle were yet to be revealed.

As the party caught their breath and turned their attention to Nezz's lifeless form, they were met with a shocking revelation. Nezz's body seemed to shift and contort, as if her very form were in flux. It was then that the truth emerged – she was not who she had appeared to be. A doppelganger, a master of deception and mimicry, had taken her place.

Mortimer, ever resourceful and quick-witted, knew that this situation required answers. He reached into his arcane knowledge and conjured a spell to speak with the dead. With a solemn incantation, he touched the doppelganger's lifeless body, invoking the magic that would allow him to glean information from beyond the grave.

The doppelganger's eyes flickered open, their gaze vacant yet haunting. Mortimer posed his question, his voice carrying a weight of curiosity and urgency. "Tell us, doppelganger, what secrets lie within Cragmaw Castle? Where can we find the map to the Wave Echo Cave?"

The doppelganger's voice, cold and detached, echoed within the chamber as it spoke. "Under the bed... where Gundar lies unconscious." The cryptic words hung in the air, a clue to their next destination.

With the information in hand, the party swiftly turned their attention to Gundar Rockseeker, the dwarf who had been bound and unconscious in the corner. They approached the bed where he lay, their hearts filled with a mix of hope and anticipation. The journey ahead was far from over, and the map to the Wave Echo Cave held the promise of answers and revelations that would shape their destiny.

But as they prepared to search for the hidden map, the realization dawned upon them that the shadows of treachery and deception still loomed large. The doppelganger's presence was a grim reminder that their enemies were cunning and elusive, and that the challenges they faced would require not only strength but also unwavering vigilance.

The doppelganger's presence was a grim reminder that their enemies were cunning and elusive, and that the challenges they faced would require not only strength but also unwavering vigilance.

Vaxidd, always the protector, couldn't help but voice his concerns. "Be on your guard, my friends. This doppelganger's presence suggests that we are dealing with a web of deceit and betrayal. Let us not underestimate our foes."

Orianna, with a reassuring smile, added, "And let's not forget that we have each other. Together, we can unravel any mystery and overcome any obstacle."

Mortimer, his mind already racing with thoughts of the arcane and the unknown, nodded in agreement. "Indeed, we shall face whatever challenges lie ahead with courage and determination. But first, let us retrieve that map and continue our quest."

Sheod, ever the keen-eyed ranger, scanned their surroundings for any signs of danger. "We've come this far, and we won't be deterred now. Let's find that map and make our next move."

With renewed purpose and a shared resolve, the champions turned their attention to the task at hand – locating the hidden map that would lead them to the Wave Echo Cave. As they began their search, the echoes of their recent battle faded into the background, replaced by the anticipation of what lay ahead in the dimly lit chambers of Cragmaw Castle.

## Glasstaff

As the champions pressed deeper into the labyrinthine corridors of Cragmaw Castle, their footsteps echoing through the ancient stones, Mortimer, the scholarly spellcaster, couldn't resist the urge to add a bit of dramatic flair to their daring infiltration.

With a sly grin, he waved his hands and chanted in a theatrical tone, "Behold, the return of the mighty Vaxidd!" In an instant, an illusion of their paladin companion, Vaxidd, materialized before the party. The illusory Vaxidd stood tall and imposing, his imaginary warhammer gleaming menacingly.

The goblins, well-known for their penchant for panic and chaos, reacted just as Mortimer had hoped. One of them, with wide, terrified eyes, squealed, "Vaxidd! He's back to haunt us!"

Another goblin, brandishing a crooked staff, shouted in agreement, "This is it! The end is nigh! We must destroy the imposter!"

Their frenzied cries echoed through the corridor as they launched a barrage of spells, arrows, and even a flying cauldron at the illusory Vaxidd.

But the real champions were already in action, moving with practiced precision. Sheod, the sharp-eyed ranger, sent a flurry of arrows flying, each one finding a goblin target with remarkable accuracy. Orianna, the bard with a knack for magical manipulation, wove a melody of dissonant whispers that further unraveled their foes' composure.

Mortimer, still wearing his sly grin, brandished his staff with a flourish and delivered resounding blows to the goblins. It was a performance that would have made any bard proud, and he couldn't help but add a cheeky comment as he struck his foes, "I always knew I had a knack for the dramatic!"

Glasstaff, the once-enigmatic wizard, found himself caught in the midst of the chaos, his plans unraveling faster than a poorly woven tapestry. The bugbear, once the embodiment of arrogance, was now faced with the illusion of Vaxidd's warhammer, and his bravado crumbled.

The goblins, now the hunted instead of the hunters, were clearly outmatched and outwitted. Their frantic tactics had backfired spectacularly.

In a desperate bid to escape, Glasstaff made a run for it, casting protective shield spells to deflect their attacks. The chase that followed was nothing short of comical, with spells and arrows flying haphazardly in all directions.

Vaxidd, his eyebrows raised in mock seriousness, shouted to his comrades, "Keep your eyes on the prize, folks! We're playing 'Tag the Wizard,' and I'm it!"

Sheod, a sly grin on his face, quipped, "Iarno, you're fast, but can you dodge an arrow and a punchline at the same time?"

Orianna, with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, added, "Looks like someone skipped 'Escaping Heroes 101' in wizard school!"

Mortimer, as he cast spells, couldn't resist a pun, "Glasstaff, I hope you brought your running shoes because this chase is electrifying!"

![](images/07-glasstaff.png)

The goblins who watched the chaotic pursuit could only exchange bewildered glances as the heroes and the fleeing wizard weaved through the castle's twists and turns. Spells ricocheted off walls, arrows whizzed past, and the once-imposing Glasstaff found himself running in circles.

Glasstaff, trying to catch his breath between spells, muttered, "Note to self: next time, challenge adventurers who take their humor as seriously as their magic."

As the chase raged on, laughter mixed with the sounds of spells and footsteps, turning what should have been a dire confrontation into a comedic spectacle for anyone fortunate enough to witness it.

But fate ad something in store. Sheod, always the patient one, took aim and let loose a true arrow that found its mark, sending Glasstaff tumbling to the ground in a most ungraceful manner.

As the echoes of victory reverberated through the castle's stone halls, Mortimer couldn't help but quip, "Well, that was quite the performance, wasn't it?"

With their foe vanquished and the goblins thoroughly bewildered, the champions stood amidst the remnants of their theatrical battle, ready to press forward into the unknown. For in the heart of Cragmaw Castle, there were still more secrets to uncover, and undoubtedly, more comedic twists and turns awaiting them.

## Bob the Goblin King

As the dust settled and the echoes of battle waned, the champions caught their breath, their victorious spirits lifting the weight of their earlier confrontation. They exchanged glances, smiles of triumph on their faces, their camaraderie deepening with each challenge they overcame.

But their moment of respite was short-lived, for on the horizon, a peculiar sight greeted them. A sizable goblin force, roughly twenty-strong, dominated the center of the approaching group. Among them, a goblin of grotesque proportions perched atop the shoulders of his kin, his massive frame defying all expectations. The adventurers, momentarily taken aback, soon recognized the unmistakable figure of their old "friend" Bob, the goblin who had once been a thorn in their side.

![](images/07-goblin-king.png)

Bob's visage was a mix of half-hearted friendliness and veiled menace as he regarded the party. His voice boomed with newfound authority as he declared, "Halt! In the name of King Bob, ruler of this castle, you shall surrender all that you have found within these walls!"

Vaxidd, never one to back down from a challenge, stepped forward, his shield raised and his brow furrowed in determination. "And who crowned you king, Bob? Last time I checked, you were a goblin nuisance."

Bob, now King Bob, corrected with a regal air, "Aye, that's right! I've upgraded from nuisance to royalty, thanks to the goblin vote of confidence!"

Sheod, with his usual dry wit, quipped, "Ah, democracy at its finest. Who knew goblins were such avid supporters of your rule?"

Mortimer, always calculating, took a step closer to Bob. "Now, King Bob, let's talk about this. We've been through quite a bit in this castle, and we might be willing to negotiate."

Orianna, her bardic charm not to be underestimated, added with a twinkle in her eye, "We could use a goblin ally in our adventures, couldn't we?"

King Bob's expression wavered, torn between his newfound authority and the prospect of an alliance. The goblins surrounding him exchanged uncertain glances, unsure of how their king should proceed.

The tension hung in the air, the fate of Cragmaw Castle and the future of their uneasy alliance teetering on the brink. The champions had faced many challenges together, but navigating the complex politics of goblin royalty was a test like no other.

## return to Phandalin

![](images/07-phandalin.png){width="300"}

As the heroes returned to Phandalin, they were greeted with a sight that took them by surprise. The once-infamous Redbrand hideout, a place that had harbored darkness and lawlessness, had been transformed into something entirely unexpected.

The townsfolk of Phandalin had taken it upon themselves to renovate the hideout, turning it into a new headquarters for the adventurers. The mayor, a shrewd and charismatic individual, had rallied the villagers with a vision of the heroes as the new protectors of Phandalin. It seemed that the influence of the adventurers had taken root not only in their deeds but in the hearts of the people as well.

As they approached the hideout, the heroes couldn't help but exchange surprised glances. The building that had once been a den of iniquity now stood as a symbol of hope and rejuvenation. Freshly painted walls, repaired roofs, and a new sign bearing the emblem of the adventurers adorned the exterior.

Inside, the hideout had been transformed into a bustling hub of activity. Villagers worked together to set up training areas, storage rooms, and even a makeshift tavern. The air was filled with the sound of hammering, laughter, and the clinking of tankards.

The mayor, a beaming figure in the midst of it all, approached the heroes with open arms. "Welcome back, my friends! I trust you find our little surprise to your liking?"

Vaxidd, the ever-dutiful paladin, couldn't help but smile at the unexpected turn of events. "You've certainly outdone yourselves, Mayor. This is more than we could have ever imagined."

Orianna, with her bardic charm, added, "It's like coming back to a completely different Phandalin."

Mortimer, the pragmatic wizard, raised an eyebrow. "I must admit, I had my doubts, but this is quite impressive."

Sheod, the stoic ranger, nodded in agreement. "It's a fitting tribute to the resilience of this town."

The mayor chuckled. "Well, we thought it was high time Phandalin had a place to call its own, and who better to protect it than the very heroes who have saved us time and time again?"

The heroes exchanged glances once more, a sense of responsibility settling over them. It seemed that their journey was far from over, and their role in Phandalin had taken on new meaning. As they settled into their renovated headquarters, they couldn't help but wonder what adventures and challenges lay ahead, and how they would continue to shape the destiny of the town they had come to call home.

The heroes made their way to the Twilight Refuge, the inn owned by Orianna's father, seeking a moment of respite and a chance to plan their next moves. With Gundran safely in their care, the atmosphere in the inn was one of both gratitude and tension.

Orianna took the lead, her voice carrying the weight of their recent adventures as she regaled her father with the tale of their encounters, from the goblin ambush to the treacherous depths of Cragmaw Castle. Her storytelling was animated, punctuated by vivid descriptions and the occasional flourish to make the events come alive.

Her father, a stout and welcoming figure, listened intently, his face reflecting a range of emotions – concern, pride, and a touch of apprehension. When Orianna concluded her narrative, he let out a sigh that seemed to release the tension he had been holding.

"Gundran, I can't thank you enough for what you've done for my daughter and her companions," he said, his voice filled with gratitude. "You're a hero in your own right, and we owe you a debt of gratitude."

Gundran, seated nearby and still recovering from his ordeal, nodded appreciatively. "I'm just glad to be alive, and I owe it to these fine adventurers."

As the conversation continued, Gundran shifted his attention to the matter at hand. "But we mustn't forget our purpose. We need to reach Wave Echo Cave as soon as possible. Time is of the essence."

![](images/07-gundran.png){width="300"}

The mention of the cave and its history hung heavy in the air. Fifteen miles east of Phandalin, in the deep vales of the Sword Mountains, Wave Echo Cave held the promise of both riches and peril. It was a place steeped in legend, where the Phandelver's Pact had once flourished before being lost to the ravages of time and orc invasions.

Gundran's account of the Rockseeker brothers' discovery and the subsequent treachery that had led to their current predicament was a stark reminder of the dangers they faced. Nezznar, the Black Spider, and his insidious plans loomed over them like a shadow.

The heroes knew that they had a chance to aid Gundran, avenge his kin, and put an end to the Black Spider's nefarious schemes. The lure of the Forge of Spells, where powerful enchantments had once been crafted, added to their determination. But they also understood that Wave Echo Cave was fraught with peril, inhabited by undead and dangerous monsters that would test their mettle.

With a day of preparation ahead, the adventurers set to work. Mortimer, the scholarly spellcaster, busied himself with preparing scrolls and spells that would aid them in the challenges to come.
