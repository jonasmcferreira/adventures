# Day 4

## Back to Tresendar Manor

The group awakens to the gentle rustling of leaves and the soft rays of the morning sun filtering through the Inn's window. They rise from their beds, stretching their weary muscles and preparing themselves for another day of travel. The events of the previous day linger in their thoughts, a testament to the dangers that await them in Phandalin.
