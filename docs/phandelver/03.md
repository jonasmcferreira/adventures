# Day 3

## Arriving at Phandalin

As the sun sets, casting its warm golden glow over the horizon, our intrepid adventurers finally arrive at the fabled city of Phandalin.

Phandalin, a place steeped in both history and tragedy, stands proudly on the remnants of a once-thriving settlement. Long ago, the town flourished in harmony with the dwarves and gnomes of the legendary Phandelver's Pact. Alas, the ravages of a savage orc horde reduced Phandalin to ruins, leaving it abandoned for countless years.

However, hope and determination have breathed new life into this forgotten place. Over the past few years, brave settlers from the bustling cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have dared to reclaim the shattered remains of Phandalin. What was once desolate now teems with life as farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and fortune seekers have flocked to these lands, enticed by rumors of untold riches hidden within the foothills of the formidable Sword Mountains. Yet, amidst this renaissance, a dark cloud looms. A notorious gang known as the Redbrands has seized control of Phandalin, inflicting fear and oppression upon its inhabitants. The shadowy figure leading the gang, known as Glasstaff, remains a mystery, haunting the dreams of the townsfolk.

As the weary travelers continue their journey, the rutted track emerges from the dense woodland, unveiling the first glimpse of Phandalin. The town stands defiantly, its simple log structures mingling with ancient fieldstone foundations. Ruins, once proud stone walls, now succumb to the relentless embrace of ivy and thorny briars, poignant reminders of a grandeur long past. The juxtaposition of old and new whispers tales of a bygone era when Phandalin thrived as a bustling hub of activity. The main thoroughfare, which was once a mere cart track, now stretches before them, morphing into a muddy artery that winds its way towards a dilapidated manor house perched upon a hill on the eastern fringes of town.

Approaching closer, the sight unfolds like a vivid tapestry. Laughter and playful shouts fill the air as children revel in the freedom of the town green. Townsfolk diligently attend to their daily chores, scurrying about the shops and market stalls, their faces a tapestry of determination and resilience. Inquisitive gazes turn towards the approaching adventurers, momentarily piqued by the unfamiliar arrivals, before returning to the pressing demands of their own lives.



Sildar, weary from his endeavour with the goblins, only wants to seek rest. He seems much more at ease.
"My friends," he says, "let us secure lodgings. I'm told the local inn is very quaint."
Sildar's plan is to get some rest at the Stonehill Inn, then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek.
Sheod the drow ranger, Mortimer the old wizard, Vaxidd the dwarven paladin and Orianna the tiefling bard have the goods that were stolen from the goblins in Cragmaw hideout, and they want to return them to the rightful owner, so they decide to head there before heading to the Inn.
Orianna is clearly avoiding going to the inn and any mention of going to the inn makes her nervous.
The group heads to the Lionshield building. Hanging above the front door of this modest trading post is a sign shaped like a wooden shield with a blue lion painted on it.
This building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of Yartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hard hit by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.)

The master of the Phandalin post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named Linene. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn't know who is responsible.
