# Day 3

## Talking around town

As the party arrived in Phandalin, they quickly learned that asking around about Cragmaw Castle was a dead end. "Cragmaw Castle? I'm sorry, I haven't heard of it," Qelline Alderleaf, a kindly halfling farmer, told them apologetically. "But I do know that the Redbrands are causing trouble around town. I've heard they hang out at the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town."

At the mention of the Redbrands, Sildar Hallwinter spoke up. "Those ruffians have been a thorn in the side of Phandalin for far too long. It's time someone took a stand against their leader, Glasstaff."

The group continued their inquiries, talking to the various townsfolk in the hopes of finding any useful information. They learned that the goblins, who had once been a problem in Phandalin, had seemingly disappeared since the Redbrands arrived. The lack of a functioning government was also evident, with the townsfolk electing a new mayor each year. The current mayor, a pompous old fool, seemed completely intimidated by the Redbrands. "Oh, they're just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really," he blustered.

As the characters wander through Phandalin, they may come across a small shrine made of worn stones from nearby ruins. The peacefulness of the shrine is interrupted by the sight of a worried-looking acolyte tending to it. Upon closer inspection, they see that she's Sister Garaele.

Approaching her, they can hear her murmur to herself, "If only I could get rid of those Redbrands...but it's hopeless." As she notices the characters, she looks up and greets them, "Greetings, travelers. I'm Sister Garaele, the caretaker of this humble shrine."

After some small talk, Sister Garaele confides in the adventurers. "I have a request, if you're willing to help. I've been trying to convince a banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook belonging to the legendary mage Bowgendle. But I can't seem to persuade her to give me a straight answer. Perhaps if someone were to bring her a gift, something shiny, she might be more willing to talk."

She pauses for a moment before continuing, "I would be eternally grateful if you could help me with this task. The spellbook in question is of great importance, and I believe it could help us rid Phandalin of the Redbrands."

The mere mention of spellbooks set Mortimer's mind racing with curiosity. His eyes lit up with a glint of fascination, and he leaned in, eager to learn more.

"Seems like there's a lot to be done in Phandalin" said Vaxidd. "But I fear we will accomplish nothing until we rid the town fo the Redbrands." stated Sheod.

Feeling frustrated, the party decided to head to the Sleeping Giant to confront the Redbrands directly. As they entered the tap house, they could hear the rowdy laughter and shouting of the ruffians.

## Brawling with the Redbrands

The Redbrands lurked inside the grimy taproom, while the adventurers peered through the dusty windows. The atmosphere was thick with tension as they surveyed the dingy establishment. Tables and chairs were scattered haphazardly, and the walls were adorned with crude paintings and unidentifiable stains. It was clear that this was not a place for the faint of heart.

Suddenly, the door burst open, and the ruffians stormed out with menacing scowls. "What the hell do you think you're doing, peeping toms?" growled one of the Redbrands, cracking his knuckles. "This is our territory, and you're not welcome here!" Another ruffian sneered, "You're gonna regret crossing us, pretty boy." The adventurers knew they were in for a fight.

The Redbrands were dressed in scarlet cloaks, their eyes fixed on the adventurers with a menacing gaze.

The adventurers stood their ground, ready for a fight. Vaxidd charged forward, his warhammer glinting in the light. With a swift swing, as if Moradin himself was hammering iron on his anvil, he hammered one of the Redbrands caving his head into his torso.

Sheod, swiftly ran at the Inn's wall, kicking it at the last minute and jumping into the air, gaining height enough to seet eh face of the ruffian at the back. He pulled his arrow back and the arrow flew, skewering him between the eyes. The ruffian was dead before he dropped to the floor.

Orianna, the bard, played her lute "I didn't know a goblin's breath could be that foul! You must have eaten something truly disgusting!". HEr insults, laced with arcane power struck the very essence of the ruffian, and he dropped, clutching his chest, dead. With a flick of his wrist, Mortimer held out his well-worn spellbook and chanted the incantation for a sleep spell. As he did, he could feel the crackle of arcane energy building within him, and he directed it towards the ruffian with a fierce determination. The ruffian, caught off guard by Mortimer's sudden attack, felt a wave of drowsiness wash over him as he struggled to keep his eyes open. Despite his efforts, however, the sleep spell overcame him, and he slumped to the ground in a deep slumber. Mortimer let out a small sigh of relief as he closed his spellbook, satisfied that the ruffian would be no threat to him or anyone else for a while.


## An unlikely ally

Orianna volunteered to go fetch the mayor, while the others kept watch over the tied-up ruffian.

As the adventurers tied up the last ruffian, they noticed a strange figure lurking in the shadows. She was a woman, with dark hair and piercing eyes, who seemed to be watching them intently. She stepped forward and introduced herself as Sariel, and she was very interested in the box that Gundren had asked them to keep safe.

"I'll give you 50gp for it," she said, her eyes glinting with avarice.

Mortimer stepped forward, his hand on his sword hilt. "Sorry, miss, but that box isn't ours to give away. It belongs to our friend Gundren."

Sariel smirked. "Ah, Gundren. Yes, I know of him. In fact, I may be able to help you find him."

The adventurers exchanged wary glances. "What do you mean?" asked Vaxidd.

"I have information about his whereabouts," said Sariel. "But it will cost you. Meet me outside of town at midnight, and I'll bring Gundren with me. We can make the exchange then."

The adventurers were skeptical. "Why should we trust you?" asked Sheod.

Sariel shrugged. "You don't have to. But I think you'll find that I'm the only one who can help you find your friend."

As they waited for Orianna's return, the Redbrands' bodies lay scattered around them, a testament to their skill and bravery. But the adventurers knew that their journey was far from over, and that danger lay ahead.
