# Day 3

## Talking around town

asking anyone in Phandalin about Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue **Gundren Rockseeker** is pointless. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. The only hint is that it might be towards the north of Phandalin.
The Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of townâ€”and that the ruffians are trouble.
it's time someone took a stand against the Redbrands' leader, Glasstaff.
The goblins stopped being a problem in Phandalin since the Redbrand's came over.
Phandalin has no functioning government, but the townsfolk elect someone to serve as Mayor each year. The Mayor serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps any records that need to be kept. A pompous old fool. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, he claims that they're "just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really."


### Tthe  Temple

Phandalin's only temple is a small shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. 

The shrine is in the care of an acolyte named Sister Garaele, who despairs of ever ridding Phandalin of the Redbrands. She needs help to persuade a banshee named Agata to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele desires an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift, jewelry or something shiny and persuade the creature to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgendle. 


## Brawling with the Redbrands

This rundown tap house is a dirty, dangerous watering hole at the end of Phandalin's main street. It is frequented by Redbrand thugs and operated by a surly female dwarf. If the characters choose to visit the place, run the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter.
The adventurees decide to visit the Sleeping giant in and show the ruffians a lesson. 3 dia, one is unconscious tied up.

The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Four human ruffians linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on you as you approach.


## An unlikely ally

The strange figure is a woman, who is very interested in the box Gundren asked us to keep and offers us to part with it fro 50gp. We explain it's not ours to give, but if she cna help us find Gundren, then we will exchange it. She asks to meet outside of town at midnight and she will bring Gundren. A very unlikely and suspicious offer which the adventurers are wary of.

## Discovering the Redbrands

More a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, but its cellars have been converted into a Redbrand stronghold
