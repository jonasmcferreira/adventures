# Day 3

## Arriving at Phandalin

As the sun sets, casting its warm golden glow over the horizon, our intrepid adventurers finally arrive at the fabled city of Phandalin.

Phandalin, a place steeped in both history and tragedy, stands proudly on the remnants of a once-thriving settlement. Long ago, the town flourished in harmony with the dwarves and gnomes of the legendary Phandelver's Pact. Alas, the ravages of a savage orc horde reduced Phandalin to ruins, leaving it abandoned for countless years.

However, hope and determination have breathed new life into this forgotten place. Over the past few years, brave settlers from the bustling cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have dared to reclaim the shattered remains of Phandalin. What was once desolate now teems with life as farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and fortune seekers have flocked to these lands, enticed by rumors of untold riches hidden within the foothills of the formidable Sword Mountains. Yet, amidst this renaissance, a dark cloud looms. A notorious gang known as the Redbrands has seized control of Phandalin, inflicting fear and oppression upon its inhabitants. The shadowy figure leading the gang, known as Glasstaff, remains a mystery, haunting the dreams of the townsfolk.

As the weary travelers continue their journey, the rutted track emerges from the dense woodland, unveiling the first glimpse of Phandalin. The town stands defiantly, its simple log structures mingling with ancient fieldstone foundations. Ruins, once proud stone walls, now succumb to the relentless embrace of ivy and thorny briars, poignant reminders of a grandeur long past. The juxtaposition of old and new whispers tales of a bygone era when Phandalin thrived as a bustling hub of activity. The main thoroughfare, which was once a mere cart track, now stretches before them, morphing into a muddy artery that winds its way towards a dilapidated manor house perched upon a hill on the eastern fringes of town.

Approaching closer, the sight unfolds like a vivid tapestry. Laughter and playful shouts fill the air as children revel in the freedom of the town green. Townsfolk diligently attend to their daily chores, scurrying about the shops and market stalls, their faces a tapestry of determination and resilience. Inquisitive gazes turn towards the approaching adventurers, momentarily piqued by the unfamiliar arrivals, before returning to the pressing demands of their own lives.

Sildar, the weary adventurer, could feel his muscles relaxing as the goblins became a distant memory. "My friends," he said with a relieved smile, "let us seek rest. I'm told the Stonehill Inn is a charming place to stay."
