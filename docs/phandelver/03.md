# Day 3

## Talking around town

As the party arrived in Phandalin, they quickly learned that asking around about Cragmaw Castle was a dead end. "Cragmaw Castle? I'm sorry, I haven't heard of it," Qelline Alderleaf, a kindly halfling farmer, told them apologetically. "But I do know that the Redbrands are causing trouble around town. I've heard they hang out at the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town."

At the mention of the Redbrands, Sildar Hallwinter spoke up. "Those ruffians have been a thorn in the side of Phandalin for far too long. It's time someone took a stand against their leader, Glasstaff."

The group continued their inquiries, talking to the various townsfolk in the hopes of finding any useful information. They learned that the goblins, who had once been a problem in Phandalin, had seemingly disappeared since the Redbrands arrived. The lack of a functioning government was also evident, with the townsfolk electing a new mayor each year. The current mayor, a pompous old fool, seemed completely intimidated by the Redbrands. "Oh, they're just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really," he blustered.

s the characters wander through Phandalin, they may come across a small shrine made of worn stones from nearby ruins. The peacefulness of the shrine is interrupted by the sight of a worried-looking acolyte tending to it. Upon closer inspection, they see that she's Sister Garaele.

Approaching her, they can hear her murmur to herself, "If only I could get rid of those Redbrands...but it's hopeless." As she notices the characters, she looks up and greets them, "Greetings, travelers. I'm Sister Garaele, the caretaker of this humble shrine."

After some small talk, Sister Garaele confides in the adventurers. "I have a request, if you're willing to help. I've been trying to convince a banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook belonging to the legendary mage Bowgendle. But I can't seem to persuade her to give me a straight answer. Perhaps if someone were to bring her a gift, something shiny, she might be more willing to talk."

Feeling frustrated, the party decided to head to the Sleeping Giant to confront the Redbrands directly. As they entered the tap house, they could hear the rowdy laughter and shouting of the ruffians.

### Tthe  Temple


## Brawling with the Redbrands

This rundown tap house is a dirty, dangerous watering hole at the end of Phandalin's main street. It is frequented by Redbrand thugs and operated by a surly female dwarf. If the characters choose to visit the place, run the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter.
The adventurees decide to visit the Sleeping giant in and show the ruffians a lesson. 3 dia, one is unconscious tied up.

The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Four human ruffians linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on you as you approach.


## An unlikely ally

The strange figure is a woman, who is very interested in the box Gundren asked us to keep and offers us to part with it fro 50gp. We explain it's not ours to give, but if she cna help us find Gundren, then we will exchange it. She asks to meet outside of town at midnight and she will bring Gundren. A very unlikely and suspicious offer which the adventurers are wary of.

## Discovering the Redbrands

More a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, but its cellars have been converted into a Redbrand stronghold
