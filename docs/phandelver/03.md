# Day 3

## Talking around town

asking anyone in Phandalin about Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue **Gundren Rockseeker** is pointless. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. The only hint is that it might be towards the north of Phandalin.
The Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of townâ€”and that the ruffians are trouble.
it's time someone took a stand against the Redbrands' leader, Glasstaff.
The goblins stopped being a problem in Phandalin since the Redbrand's came over.

### Tthe  Temple

Phandalin's only temple is a small shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. 

The shrine is in the care of an acolyte named Sister Garaele, who despairs of ever ridding Phandalin of the Redbrands. She needs help to persuade a banshee named Agata to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele desires an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift, jewelry a jeweled silver comb, and persuade the creature to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character who flatters Agatha's vanity might be able to trade the comb for an answer. She offers the quest to the characters and offers them three potions of healing as payment for their efforts. If the party pursues this quest, see "Conyberry and Agatha's Lair" (page 28).

#### Joining the Harpers

If the party helps Garaele learn the fate of Bowgentle's spellbook, the elf privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Harpers. She speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the network and possess a desire to enact positive change through information and secrecy. If a character agrees, Sister Garaele awards the individual the title of Watcher.






## Brawling with the Redbrands

The adventurees decide to visit the Sleeping giant in and show the ruffians a lesson. 3 dia, one is unconscious tied up.

## An unlikely ally

The strange figure is a woman, who is very interested in the box Gundren asked us to keep and offers us to part with it fro 50gp. We explain it's not ours to give, but if she cna help us find Gundren, then we will exchange it. She asks to meet outside of town at midnight and she will bring Gundren. A very unlikely and suspicious offer which the adventurers are wary of.
