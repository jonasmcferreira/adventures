# Day 3

## Talking around town

asking anyone in Phandalin about Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue **Gundren Rockseeker** is pointless. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. The only hint is that it might be towards the north of Phandalin.
The Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of townâ€”and that the ruffians are trouble.
it's time someone took a stand against the Redbrands' leader, Glasstaff.
The goblins stopped being a problem in Phandalin since the Redbrand's came over.
