## To the Wave Echo Cave

As the party materialized within the narrow tunnel hidden in the foothills of the Sword Mountains, the abrupt transition from Phandalin's serenity to the dark, cavernous depths of the earth left them momentarily disoriented. Orianna, with her musical grace, was the first to regain her bearings. She looked around, her gaze sweeping the cavern that unfolded before them.

The entrance tunnel led them into a vast underground chamber, its boundaries marked by towering stalagmites that reached toward the heavens like ancient sentinels of stone. Natural pillars of rock supported the massive weight of the earth above, and the air was filled with the earthy scent of dampness and age. It was a stark contrast to the open skies and rolling hills they had grown accustomed to.

Sheod, always vigilant, took a cautious step forward, his keen elven senses alert to any potential threats. Vaxidd, the unwavering protector, held his shield high, ready to defend his companions. Mortimer, the enigmatic scholar, adjusted his spectacles and surveyed their surroundings with a mix of curiosity and trepidation.

The party's entrance didn't go unnoticed. In the western part of the cavern, behind a massive column of rock, their eyes fell upon an unexpected sight—three simple bedrolls and a haphazard collection of supplies strewn about. Sacks of flour, bags of salt, and casks of salted meat mingled with lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other mining gear. Among this utilitarian clutter lay the lifeless form of a dwarf miner, his fate sealed in the depths of the earth at least a week prior.

Orianna's expression shifted from curiosity to somberness as she recognized the tragic scene. "This was the campsite of the Rockseekers," she murmured, her voice carrying the weight of the realization. "Tharden... Gundren's brother," she added, the name spoken like a solemn epitaph for the fallen dwarf.

Vaxidd's eyes narrowed with determination. "And Nundro is the Black Spider's prisoner," he stated, his voice leaving no room for doubt. The fate of their friend and ally hung heavily in the air, a stark reminder of the urgency of their mission.

The supplies, while not particularly valuable, still held the potential for usefulness. The adventurers surveyed the assortment of gear, contemplating their choices. Mortimer, ever the pragmatist, examined the items with an eye for practicality. "These supplies might come in handy down the line," he remarked, his fingers tracing the outlines of pickaxes and shovels.

Amid the myriad of objects, a sturdy hemp rope caught Sheod's attention. It was tied off securely around a nearby stalagmite and dangled down the side of a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit that marred the northeastern section of the cavern. The pit was an ominous reminder of the dangers that lurked beneath the earth's surface.

With a nod of agreement, Orianna added, "That rope could be essential for our descent into the unknown. We should make sure to take it with us."

The party's options lay before them, illuminated only by the faint glow of lanterns and the dim light filtering through the stalactites above. The choices they made in this moment would determine the path they followed deeper into the heart of Wave Echo Cave, where the shadows of the past and the looming threat of the Black Spider awaited their arrival.

As the party stood on the precipice of the pit, uncertainty lingering in the air like a shroud, Mortimer couldn't resist the urge to inject a bit of levity into the situation. His voice, tinged with playful sarcasm, broke the silence that had settled over the group.

"Ah, you know, it's moments like these that make me truly appreciate my profession," he quipped, adjusting his spectacles with exaggerated theatrics. "I mean, who doesn't love spelunking in the pitch-black unknown with nothing but a few lanterns and the hope that gravity is on our side?"

Vaxidd, his stoic demeanor unyielding, gave Mortimer an unamused glance. "Quit your jesting, Mortimer. We have a mission to accomplish, and we can't afford any missteps."

Mortimer chuckled in response, his voice lighthearted despite the gravity of their situation. "Oh, come now, my dear paladin. I'm just trying to shed some light on the situation, or lack thereof. Besides, I can't see a thing down there. Perhaps our brave protector should lead the way, shining his beacon of righteousness into the abyss."

Vaxidd, ever the dutiful guardian, didn't need any more encouragement. He stepped forward, shield raised, and began the descent into the pit with resolute determination. The rest of the party followed suit, their lanterns casting flickering shadows on the cavern walls as they descended into the unknown depths.

Mortimer's jests may have added a touch of humor to their journey, but the looming presence of Wave Echo Cave and the weight of their mission were never far from their minds. With each step into the darkness, they drew closer to uncovering the secrets of the past and confronting the menacing threat of the Black Spider, their resolve unshaken by the challenges that lay ahead.

## the large room

The party ventured deeper into the heart of the cavern, their lanterns casting eerie shadows on the rough-hewn walls. The air was heavy with the weight of history and the lingering remnants of a battle fought long ago. As they reached the threshold of the old guardroom, the grim scene that unfolded before them spoke of the tragedy that had befallen the dwarves and orcs who once called this place their stronghold.

Splintered stone benches and piles of rubble lay scattered about, bearing witness to the violence that had torn through the chamber. Broken bunks and toppled weapon racks whispered tales of a desperate last stand. And amidst the debris, the skeletal remains of both dwarves and orcs lay as silent witnesses to the past.

The party approached cautiously, their eyes scanning the room for any signs of danger. It was then that the drow ranger, Sheod, took a bold step forward, crossing the threshold into the chamber. In an instant, the bones that had lain dormant for centuries began to stir, a macabre dance of reanimation.

Sheod retreated with lightning speed, the skeletons crumbling back down to the floor as if only the presence of the living awakened the skeletons. The adventurers stood at the precipice of a battle they hadn't anticipated, their weapons drawn and their resolve steeled.

"Well, that is certainly a bone-chilling encounter! But don't worry, folks, I've always believed in a fair fight – after all, it's only fair that we get all these nifty weapons, right?" Mortimer, the ever-cunning spellcaster, saw an opportunity amidst the chaos. With a flick of his fingers and a focused concentration, he summoned his telekinetic powers. One by one, the weapons, shields, and helmets that had once belonged to the fallen dwarves and orcs lifted into the air, hovering in a spectral display of force.

With delicate precision, Mortimer brought the weapons and equipment out of the room, each piece floating effortlessly into the waiting hands of the adventurers. Spirits high, they ventured back into the chamber, now facing a legion of unarmed skeletons.

The battle that followed was a testament to their teamwork and ingenuity. The skeletons, devoid of weapons, were no match for the champions as they fought with a coordinated effort that left no room for hesitation. Blades clashed, magic crackled, and the skeletal foes were dismantled one by one, reduced to lifeless bones once more.

As the last skeleton crumbled, the chamber fell silent, save for the ragged breaths of the victorious adventurers. They exchanged glances, a mix of relief and triumph in their eyes. The old guardroom, once a place of death and despair, had become a testament to their resourcefulness and resilience. With their newfound gear and a renewed sense of purpose, they continued their descent into the depths of Wave Echo Cave, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
