# In Neverwinter

![neverwinter-city](../images/neverwinter-city.png)

In the dimly lit Driftwood Tavern of Neverwinter, a group of adventurers found themselves brought together by fate. Mortimer, a studious mage with robes adorned with arcane symbols; Vaxidd, a stout and righteous dwarf, his armor bearing the proud insignia of Moradin; Orianna, a charismatic tiefling bard with a mischievous smile; and Sheod, a mysterious drow ranger, cloaked in shadows.

As they sat at a worn wooden table, sipping their drinks and discussing their past exploits, a burly dwarf with a bushy brown beard approached them. It was Gundren Rockseeker, a name whispered among adventurers for his reputation and wealth.

"Good evening, esteemed travelers," Gundren greeted them warmly, his voice carrying a touch of excitement. "I have a proposition for you, if you're willing to listen."

The group exchanged curious glances, their interest piqued by the dwarf's presence. Mortimer motioned for Gundren to take a seat at their table, inviting him to share his proposal.

"I need a group of capable escorts to ensure the safe delivery of a wagon filled with supplies to the town of Phandalin," Gundren began, his eyes flickering with a mix of anticipation and urgency. "My friend Sildar Hallwinter and I have important business to attend to there, and we can't afford any mishaps along the way."

Sheod leaned forward, his piercing gaze fixed on Gundren. "And what exactly is in this wagon of yours?" he inquired, a hint of skepticism in his voice.

Gundren leaned back, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Ah, a fair question," he responded, his tone tinged with secrecy. "Let's just say that it holds something of great value, both sentimentally and monetarily. It must reach its destination intact."

Mortimer, ever the pragmatic one, raised an eyebrow. "What's in it for us?" he asked, his voice laced with a touch of mischief.

Gundren's smile broadened as he reached into his pocket, producing a small leather pouch. He placed it on the table, and the clinking sound of gold coins filled the air. "Ten gold pieces each, my friends," he offered, his eyes gleaming with sincerity. "And, of course, the gratitude of a grateful dwarf."

Vaxidd, his eyes sparkling with noble determination, spoke up. "Your cause seems just, Gundren. We will gladly aid you in this task."

Orianna nodded, her tail flicking with excitement. "And a chance for adventure and a full purse? Count me in!" she chimed in, a mischievous grin spreading across her face.

Gundren's eyes twinkled with appreciation as he stood up, ready to depart. "Wonderful! Meet me at the town square tomorrow morning, and we'll set off on this grand journey together."

With heartfelt farewells, the adventurers bid Gundren farewell, their minds already filled with visions of the road ahead. They dispersed into the night, each preparing themselves mentally and physically for the task that awaited them.

The following morning, the sun rose with renewed vigor, casting its warm rays upon the town square. The adventurers gathered, their armor gleaming, their weapons at their sides. Excitement coursed through their veins as they set their sights on the road that would lead them to Phandalin.

Little did they know that this seemingly simple task would be the beginning of a grand adventure, a journey that would test their mettle, forge unbreakable bonds, and reveal secrets that would shape their destinies. With hearts ablaze, they embarked on their quest, ready to face the challenges that awaited them on the path to Phandalin.
