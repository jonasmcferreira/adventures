# In Neverwinter

Mortimer, a human mage, Vaxidd, a dwarf paladin of Moradin, Orianna, a female tiefling bard, and Sheod, a drow ranger, make up an unlikely group of adventurers. They all meet in the Driftwood Tavern in Neverwinter, at the request of Gundren Rockseeker.

Gundren Rockseeker, a burly dwarf with a bushy brown beard, arranged for the group of adventurers to meet him there. He approached the adventurers as they were sitting at a table, discussing their next move.

“Good evening to you all,” Gundren greeted them with a friendly smile. “ Thank you for meeting me here. You are a group of capable adventurers, and I have a proposition for you, if you’re interested.”

The group looked at him curiously, intrigued by his proposal.

“I need a group of reliable escorts to bring a wagon of supplies to the town of Phandalin,” The dwarf pauses for a moment before continuing, “I’ll be heading out tomorrow with my friend Sildar Hallwinter. We have some business to attend to in the town of Phandalin. You lot can follow us with the supplies. It’s a simple job, really. All you need to do is keep the wagon safe and make sure the goods arrive in one piece.”

Mortimer, the group’s mage, raised an eyebrow. “What’s in it for us?” he asked.

Gundren reached into his pocket and pulled out a small leather pouch. “Ten gold pieces each,” he said, jingling the pouch for emphasis. "And my eternal gratitude. The goods are important to me, and I wouldn’t trust just anyone with them. You’ll be paid by the owner of Barthen’s Provisions in Phandalin when you deliver the goods safely to him.

Vaxidd, the group’s paladin, spoke up. “We would be happy to help you, cousin Gundren. It sounds like a noble cause.”

Orianna, the tiefling bard, nodded in agreement. “And we could use the gold,” she added with a grin.

Gundren smiled, relieved that he had found a group of adventurers willing to take on the task. “Excellent. Meet me at the town square tomorrow morning, and we’ll get started.”

With that, Gundren bid them farewell and left the inn, his mind already turning to the important business he needed to attend to in Phandalin.
