![page break](../images/eldrin-blackwood.png){ width="300" }

Eldrin's childhood was steeped in the traditions of nobility and the high expectations of his father, Lord Alistair Blackwood. Lord Alistair was a close advisor to the royal family of Drakkenheim and a staunch upholder of law and order. His relationship with Eldrin was a complex blend of stern mentorship and paternal concern. Eldrin was groomed to follow in his father’s footsteps, being educated in the political, military, and social intricacies of noble life. The unyielding expectations from his father to uphold the family honor and continue the Blackwood lineage often weighed heavily upon Eldrin's shoulders. Yet, the respect and admiration Eldrin held for his father compelled him to strive toward these expectations.

His mother, Lady Marianne, was his solace amidst the stern world of nobility. Lady Marianne was a kind-hearted woman with a love for arts and literature. She encouraged Eldrin to explore the world beyond the strict boundaries of nobility, nurturing his curious and imaginative side. Her gentle ways provided a balance to the stern discipline imparted by his father.

From a young age, Eldrin was enrolled in the prestigious clerical institution known as The Sanctum of Order, located in a tranquil part of Drakkenheim away from the bustling heart of the city. This was a tradition in the Blackwood family to ensure that its heirs were imbued with a strong sense of duty, discipline, and a moral compass aligned with the principles of order and righteousness. Under the stern but wise mentorship of High Cleric Bartholomew, Eldrin delved into the studies of theology, divine rituals, and the moral codes that govern the laws of both men and gods.

His clerical training also entailed rigorous physical drills to hone his combat skills, as a cleric of order was expected to be a bulwark against chaos and a guardian of the societal structure. These years of disciplined training under the vigilant eye of High Cleric Bartholomew forged a strong, dutiful personality within Eldrin, echoing his father’s teachings of upholding the Blackwood legacy of loyalty, honor, and duty.

The fall of the meteor on Drakkenheim was a cataclysmic event that shattered Eldrin's world. The Blackwood estate in the city was obliterated, claiming the lives of both Lord Alistair and Lady Marianne. This tragedy wasn’t just a personal loss for Eldrin, but also a grave threat to the legacy of the Blackwoods. With no heir to carry forward the family's lineage and uphold its noble status,the name of Blackwood faced the threat of fading into oblivion. This crisis weighed heavily on Eldrin, igniting a fervent resolve to reclaim and restore his family's honor and position in Drakkenheim.

Amidst this crisis, whispers of an ancient secret started surfacing. It was rumored that the Blackwoods were privy to a royal secret that could potentially alter the power dynamics within the royalty of Drakkenheim. This secret was believed to be known only to Lord Alistair and a few within the royal circle. With his father's demise, the onus of uncovering and wielding this secret fell upon Eldrin. The secret was said to be a lever of power or leverage over the royalty, a clandestine truth that, if revealed, could significantly benefit the Blackwood family, reinstating their position within the royal court and possibly even beyond.

Uncle Eadric, who was believed to have survived the calamity, might be the only other person who might have knowledge about this royal secret. However, his whereabouts were unknown since he lived in a part of the city now ravaged by the meteor's impact.

The catastrophe that struck Drakkenheim brought a tide of change in Eldrin's life. The tragedy of losing his parents was not only a personal loss but a loss of the structured world he had always known. Amidst the ruins of his former life, Eldrin began to feel an unexplainable stirring within his soul, a whisper of power that beckoned him towards a path less trodden by the nobles of Blackwood lineage.

Despite the awe-inspiring allure of this newfound power, Eldrin chose to keep it a secret. The world of arcane magic was often viewed with skepticism and fear amongst the nobility, and the disclosure of his sorcerous tendencies could jeopardize his family's already precarious standing. Moreover, the principles of order and tradition ingrained in him during his clerical training resonated with a voice of caution against the unpredictable realm of arcane magic.

Yet, the potential of this arcane path to restore his family's honor and unravel the royal secret was too promising to ignore. Eldrin seeks discreet guidance from the Amethyst Academy, under the guise of exploring magical means to protect and restore Drakkenheim.  His dual life as a cleric of order and a clandestine sorcerer became a delicate dance between the structured world of his past and the boundless realm of arcane possibilities.
