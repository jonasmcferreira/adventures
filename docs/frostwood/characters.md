## Daylon Galestride: Outlaw Turned Tempest Cleric

![](images/daylon.png)

Daylon Galestride was born to a minor noble family on Alaron, the largest of the Moonshae Isles. As the second son, he was not in line to inherit the family estate and was often overlooked in favor of his elder brother. Seeking attention and excitement, Daylon fell in with the island's smugglers and pirates, using his family's influence to aid their illicit activities. His charisma and brute strength quickly earned him a reputation as a fearsome enforcer, known for his lightning-fast strikes during raids.

However, when his elder brother unexpectedly died, his family called him back to assume his responsibilities. Daylon found the noble life stifling and continued his criminal activities in secret, which eventually led to a tragic incident where a smuggling operation turned into a bloodbath. Daylon, though he escaped, was left with a severe wound and a heavy heart, as innocent lives were lost due to his actions.

Hiding from both the law and his former comrades, Daylon sought refuge in the wilderness of the isles. Lost, both physically and spiritually, he stumbled upon a secluded shrine battered by a relentless storm. It was here, within the eye of the tempest, that Daylon found solace and encountered the presence of a storm deity. The deity offered him a path to atonement: to become a tempest cleric and wield the storm's might to protect those he once would have preyed upon.

Daylon accepted the deity's offer, his outlaw's cunning and ferocity giving way to the disciplined focus of a cleric. He adopted the name Galestride, a testament to his new path, and vowed to use his powers to uphold the balance of nature and guard the innocent.

His transformation made him a target for his former allies, who felt betrayed, and the law, which still sought him for his past crimes. Daylon knew he needed to leave the Moonshae Isles. He heard tales of Frostwood, a frontier settlement to the north of Silverymoon that was a haven for those seeking second chances or escaping troubled pasts.

The journey was long and arduous, filled with self-doubt and the temptation to revert to his old ways. Yet, the farther north he traveled, the more he proved his dedication to his new calling. Upon reaching Frostwood, he found a community that needed protection and guidance, a place where he could be more than his past.
