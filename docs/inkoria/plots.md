## Plot one

Introduction: The story begins with the wizard captured and the cleric as part of the escort assigned to transport the wizard to a specific location, such as a prison or a court for trial.

They start questioning the validity of the prohibition on magic, the motivations of the regime, and the true nature of justice. The cleric's growing connection with the wizard and the realization of the wizard's inherent goodness begin to change their heart and beliefs.

A Common Cause: As the journey progresses, the cleric and the wizard discover evidence of a greater conspiracy or threat that affects both the lower pantheons and the higher pantheons of gods.

Climactic Confrontation: The story culminates in a climactic confrontation with the leaders of the oppressive regime. With their newfound unity, the cleric and the wizard lead a rebellion against the unjust rule, using their combined strengths to fight against the regime's forces and to challenge the control of the higher pantheons.

Resolution and Rebirth: The story ends with the overthrow of the oppressive regime and the restoration of a more balanced and just society in Inkoria. The cleric's journey of transformation is complete, having undergone a profound shift in beliefs and values. The wizard is recognized not as a criminal but as a symbol of resilience and the potential of magic, with their abilities embraced rather than feared.

This story arc allows for a gradual evolution of the cleric's perspective, as they undergo personal growth and realize the injustices inherent in the prohibition on magic.
