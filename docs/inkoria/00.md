# The Beginning

The rain poured relentlessly from the darkened sky, drenching the weary travelers and turning the dusty road into a muddy path. The slave caravan trudged forward, the heavy chains clanking with each step as the prisoners fought to keep their footing in the treacherous terrain. The stench of wet earth mingled with the tang of fear and desperation, permeating the air.

The rain cascaded down, its droplets tracing a meandering path across the captive figures locked within the confines of the iron cage. Among them, a man leaned against the cold metal of the cage, his gaze flickering with a light that defied the somber weather. His soaked garments clung to his lithe frame, revealing glimpses of intricate markings subtly etched across his exposed skin. Each rune, meticulously crafted, whispered of ancient knowledge and unseen forces at his command.

Beside him, a middle-aged man slumped, his weary eyes glancing toward the enigmatic figure intermittently. Rainwater trickled down his disheveled hair, mingling with the dirt smudges on his face. His gaze lingered for a moment longer on the runes before reluctantly shifting away, acknowledging a power beyond comprehension.

"They won't break us," he murmured, his voice carrying a note of conviction laced with wonder. "Your runes... they hold power, don't they?"

The man's eyes softened, a faint glimmer of a smile tugging at the corners of his rain-kissed lips. Raindrops splashed upon his hands, each drop revealing intricate patterns of inked symbols etched across his skin—subtle testaments to his arcane connection with the world. His response was measured, a low rumble beneath the downpour.

"Strength lies in patience," he said, his voice carrying a quiet resolve that resonated with hidden power. "Opportunity will reveal itself"

The rhythmic sound of hooves, accompanied by the pattering rain, echoed through the air as the slavers rode ahead, their hardened gazes meeting the enigmatic wizard's for the briefest of moments. Meanwhile, the cleric, positioned alongside the wagon of supplies, cast wary glances toward the captive figures, his eyes lingering on the glowing runes.

Amidst the relentless downpour, the imprisoned figures trudged forward, their steps mirroring the steady rhythm of the arcane energy swirling within their midst. Each raindrop that kissed the wizard's adorned skin seemed to carry whispers of forgotten spells and long-lost incantations, beckoning toward a world where the power of the written word would reignite the flames of freedom.

In the realm of Inkoria, where ink and magic intertwined, the runes discreetly etched upon the wizard's skin served as a testament to his forbidden craft. With each passing moment, the journey to Sandhaven became more than a path to captivity—it transformed into an opportunity for a spell-weaver's awakening, as the subtle glow of the runes promised the imminent dawn of a power that would shape the fate of Inkoria itself.
