# Chapter 2: The Enigmatic Prisoner

The relentless downpour continued its assault on the weary travelers, each raindrop a reminder of their grim circumstances. The caravan pressed on, a disheartened procession trudging through the mire. Two ox-pulled wagons with steel cages rattled along the muddy road, accompanied by a lone rider. It was an unconventional assembly of captors and captives, brought together by a cruel twist of fate.

Driving the wagons were two figures, their gruff and hardened faces etched with the lines of their ruthless trade. They commanded the captives, their eyes void of empathy as they urged the oxen forward. Chains clinked with every jolt of the wagons, a haunting melody that pierced through the relentless downpour.

The rain fell incessantly, drenching the captive figures locked within the iron cage. Among them, one stood out—a man whose eyes burned with an intensity that defied the gloomy weather. His soaked clothes clung to his lean frame, revealing a wiry strength beneath the tattered fabric. Though confined, his presence exuded an air of resilience, his piercing gaze surveying the surroundings with an innate understanding.

Beside him, a middle-aged prisoner shared his fate, his legs dangling out the side of the wagon, eyes shifting between the man and the daunting surroundings. Rainwater trickled down his red tangled hair, blending with the dirt on his weary face. He glimpsed the enigmatic runes discreetly etched upon the man's exposed skin, a spark of recognition igniting within his tired eyes.

"They won't break us," he murmured, his voice carrying a note of quiet defiance. "Your marks... they hold power, don't they?"

The man's gaze softened, his features briefly illuminated by a flicker of recognition and solidarity amidst the deluge. He nodded, the subtle movement a silent confirmation of shared understanding. "Strength lies in patience," he replied, his voice an undertone of resolute determination that defied the rain's incessant drumming. "Opportunity will unveil itself."

Riding a few paces behind the slavers, a young man traveled alongside them, his presence an intriguing juxtaposition in this procession of darkness. His face wore an expression of youthful uncertainty, his eyes darting nervously between the captives and the imposing figures leading the way. Raindrops clung to his cloak, mirroring the doubt that clung to his soul. Secured to his belt, a small leather pouch swung gently with every step he took. It contained a collection of dried herbs and vials of soothing salves.

Forced to accompany the slavers, his purpose was to ensure the captives remained healthy and fit for sale in Sandhaven. Bound by duty, he rode alongside the slavers, a reluctant companion in their arduous journey through the rain-soaked wilderness. His youthful features concealed an inner turmoil, a constant battle between his compassionate nature and the harsh reality that engulfed him.

As his gaze swept over the prisoners, Pascoe's attention was captivated by the enigmatic figure confined within the cage. A spark of suspicion ignited within him, for there was an air of defiance in the way they carried themselves. His eyes instinctively gravitated toward the figure leaning against the iron cage. His ragged clothes hid it, but there were subtle yet unmistakable markings adorning his skin, a language of ancient glyphs that whispered of a forbidden art. Magic.

Fear held his voice captive, for he knew that speaking out could endanger not only himself but also the fragile hope that flickered within the imprisoned wizard. For now, he would keep his revelation to himself, allowing curiosity and concern to weave a tapestry of questions in his mind. As the rain continued to fall, each droplet carried the weight of forbidden knowledge, a secret shared only by those who dared to delve into the realm of the arcane against the laws of Inkoria.

His gaze met that of the tattooed man in the cage for a brief moment, a fleeting exchange that held the promise of a shared understanding. In that unspoken connection, the young man sensed a glimmer of something greater, a purpose that extended beyond the confines of their current circumstances. He knew the captive knew what he was.

The rain continued seeping into their bones, sapping their warmth. The tattooed prisoner, Aric, felt every raindrop like a taunting reminder of his confined existence. The iron cage, his prison, had become both sanctuary and torment, shielding him from the world yet trapping him in a relentless cycle of despair. His muscles cramped constantly in the confined space, a constant reminder of his predicament.

Days blurred together within the confines of the cage, the monotony broken only by the jangling of chains and the occasional creaking of the wooden wagon carrying them. Aric and his fellow captives endured the physical hardships of their confinement, their bodies growing weak and weary. The slop they were fed once a day provided meager sustenance, barely enough to stave off hunger. Water, rationed out sparingly, offered only a brief respite from parched throats.

Amidst this bleak existence, Pascoe moved with gentle determination. His eyes swept over the imprisoned souls, his heart burdened by the suffering he witnessed. Wounds and ailments plagued the captives, the result of cramped quarters and the unforgiving nature of their circumstances.

When the caravan made camp, Pascoe would inspect each of the seven prisoners. "Let me tend to your wounds," Pascoe's voice carried a gentle reassurance, his touch as tender as his words. He examined their injuries with a practiced eye, looking for sores, infections, and fevers. In these conditions, with the poor slop the prisoners were being fed, it was easy for disease to set in, so the slavers employed Pascoe to tend to them. His hands moved with purpose and care as he inspected the captives. Battered  they found a glimmer of hope in his presence, a flicker of compassion in this world devoid of mercy.

Aric observed Pascoe's actions among the prisoners, his gaze drawn to the glimmer of a braid pendant discreetly nestled within Pascoe's hair. The sight struck him as curious, a healer lending aid to the slavers. The braid marked him as a man of faith and devotion. "Odd," he thought, his weary mind pondering the incongruity. "What is a healer doing helping slavers?" A subtle sense of intrigue lingered in his thoughts, though the answers remained elusive.

The slavers watched Pascoe's actions with a mixture of indifference and annoyance. To them, the captives were nothing more than commodities to be sold and discarded. They cared little for the toll their confinement took on their bodies and spirits. They were more concerned about reaching their destination and relieving their winnings in the nearest inn.

As Pascoe nears Aric, applying salve to the skin around his wrists, which have scarred and begun to bleed again, Aric mumbles loud enough for Pascoe to hear “I didn’t know Aeshara helped slavers”. Pascoe paused momentarily, senses on high alert since he was travelling in secret, but once he understood the other slaves did not overhear him nor the slavers, he continued his care.

“Where she sends, I follow. And if you keep scratching these scabs on your wrists you’re going to end up losing your hands... and your marks” retorted Pascoe, nodding to the tattoos which Aric thought was hiding.
