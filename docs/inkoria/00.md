# The Beginning

The relentless downpour continued its assault on the weary travelers, each raindrop a reminder of their grim circumstances. The caravan pressed on, a disheartened procession trudging through the mire. Two ox-pulled wagons with steel cages rattled along the muddy road, accompanied by a lone rider. It was a haphazard assembly of captors and captives, brought together by the cruel hand of fate.

Driving the wagons were two figures, their gruff and hardened faces etched with the lines of their ruthless trade. They commanded the captives, their eyes void of empathy as they urged the oxen forward. Chains clinked with every jolt of the wagons, a haunting melody that pierced through the relentless downpour.

The rain fell incessantly, drenching the captive figures locked within the iron cage. Among them, one stood out—a man whose eyes burned with an intensity that seemed to defy the gloomy weather. His soaked clothes clung to his lean frame, revealing a wiry strength beneath the tattered fabric. Though confined, his presence exuded an air of resilience, his piercing gaze surveying the surroundings with an innate understanding.

Beside him, a middle-aged companion shared his fate, his eyes shifting between the man and the daunting surroundings. Rainwater trickled down his tangled hair, blending with the dirt on his weary face. He glimpsed the enigmatic runes discreetly etched upon the man's exposed skin, a spark of recognition igniting within his tired eyes. It spoke of something far greater than their current plight—an intricate web of knowledge and power hidden beneath the surface.

"They won't break us," he murmured, his voice carrying a note of quiet defiance. "Your marks... they hold sway, don't they?"

The man's gaze softened, his features briefly illuminated by a flicker of recognition and solidarity amidst the deluge. He nodded, the subtle movement a silent confirmation of shared understanding. "Strength lies in patience," he replied, his voice an undertone of resolute determination that defied the rain's incessant drumming. "Opportunity will unveil itself."

Walking a few paces behind the slavers, a young man traveled alongside them, his presence an intriguing juxtaposition in this procession of darkness. His face bore an expression of youthful uncertainty, his eyes darting nervously between the captives and the imposing figures leading the way. Raindrops clung to his cloak, mirroring the doubt that clung to his soul.

The young man was no stranger to the ways of the world, yet the weight of his current role sat heavily upon his shoulders. Bound by duty, he walked alongside the slavers, a companion in their journey through the rain-soaked wilderness. His youthful features hid an inner turmoil, a struggle between his compassionate nature and the harsh reality that surrounded him.

As his gaze swept over the prisoners, his attention was drawn to the enigmatic figure within the cage. There was something about the way they held themselves, a glimmer of resilience amidst their captivity. His eyes were drawn to the faint traces of discreet markings adorning their skin, symbols of a power he could only guess at.

A spark of suspicion flickered within the young man's mind, a question lingering on the tip of his tongue. But fear held his voice captive, for he knew that speaking out could endanger not only himself but also the fragile hope that flickered within the imprisoned wizard.

Raindrops mingled with the young man's uncertainty as he continued his silent vigil, a silent observer in this grim procession. His gaze met that of the tattooed man in the cage for a brief moment, a fleeting exchange that held the promise of a shared understanding. In that un spoken connection, the young man sensed a glimmer of something greater, a purpose that extended beyond the confines of their current circumstances.

The rain continued seeping into their bones, sapping their warmth. The tattooed prisoner, Aric, felt every raindrop like a taunting reminder of his confined existence. The iron cage, his prison, had become both sanctuary and torment, shielding him from the world yet trapping him in a relentless cycle of despair. His muscles cramped constantly in the confined space, a constant reminder of his predicament.
