# The Beginning

The rain poured relentlessly from the darkened sky, drenching the weary travelers and turning the dusty road into a muddy path. The caravan trudged forward, the heavy chains clanking with each step as the prisoners fought to keep their footing in the treacherous terrain. The stench of wet earth mingled with the tang of fear and desperation, permeating the air.

The rain cascaded down, its droplets tracing a meandering path across the captive figures locked within the confines of the iron cage. Among them, a man leaned against the cold metal of the cage, his gaze flickering with a light that defied the somber weather. His soaked garments clung to his lithe frame, revealing glimpses of intricate markings subtly etched across his exposed skin. Each rune, meticulously crafted, whispered of ancient knowledge and unseen forces at his command.

Beside him, a middle-aged man slumped, his legs dangling over the side of the caravan through the cage’s bars, his weary eyes glancing toward the enigmatic figure intermittently. Rainwater trickled down his disheveled hair, mingling with the dirt smudges on his face. His gaze lingered for a moment longer on the runes before reluctantly shifting away, acknowledging a power beyond comprehension.

"They won't break us," he murmured, his voice carrying a note of conviction laced with wonder. "Your runes... they hold power, don't they?"

The man's eyes softened, a faint glimmer of a smile tugging at the corners of his rain-kissed lips. His response was measured, a low rumble beneath the downpour. "Strength lies in patience," he said, his voice carrying a quiet resolve that resonated with hidden power. "Opportunity will reveal itself”.
