# The Beginning

The relentless downpour continued its assault on the weary travelers, each raindrop a reminder of their grim circumstances. The caravan pressed on, a disheartened procession trudging through the mire. It was a haphazard assembly of captors and captives, brought together by the cruel hand of fate.

Leading the way were two figures, their gruff hardened faces etched with the lines of their ruthless trade. They commanded the captives, their eyes void of empathy as they herded them forward. Chains clinked with every step, a haunting melody that pierced through the relentless downpour.

the rain fell incessantly, drenching the captive figures locked within the iron cage. Among them, one stood out—a man whose eyes burned with an intensity that seemed to defy the gloomy weather. His soaked clothes clung to his lean frame, revealing a wiry strength beneath the tattered fabric. Though confined, his presence exuded an air of resilience, his piercing gaze surveying the surroundings with an innate understanding.

Beside him, a middle-aged companion shared his fate, his eyes shifting between the man and the daunting surroundings. Rainwater trickled down his tangled hair, blending with the dirt on his weary face. He glimpsed the enigmatic runes, a spark of recognition igniting within his tired eyes, acknowledging the existence of something far greater than their current plight.

"They won't break us," he murmured, his voice carrying a note of quiet defiance. "Your marks... they hold sway, don't they?"

The man's gaze softened, his features briefly illuminated by a flicker of recognition and solidarity amidst the deluge. He nodded, the subtle movement a silent confirmation of shared understanding. "Strength lies in patience," he replied, his voice an undertone of resolute determination that defied the rain's incessant drumming. "Opportunity will unveil itself."

Walking a few paces behind the slavers, a young man traveled alongside them, his presence an intriguing juxtaposition in this procession of darkness. His face bore an expression of youthful uncertainty, his eyes darting nervously between the captives and the imposing figures leading the way. Raindrops clung to his cloak, mirroring the doubt that clung to his soul.

The young man was no stranger to the ways of the world, yet the weight of his current role sat heavily upon his shoulders. Bound by duty, he walked alongside the slavers, a companion in their journey through the rain-soaked wilderness. His youthful features hid an inner turmoil, a struggle between his compassionate nature and the harsh reality that surrounded him.

As his gaze swept over the prisoners, his attention was drawn to the enigmatic figure within the cage. There was something about the way they held themselves, a glimmer of resilience amidst their captivity. His eyes were drawn to the faint traces of discreet markings adorning their skin, symbols of a power he could only guess at.

A spark of suspicion flickered within the young man's mind, a question lingering on the tip of his tongue. But fear held his voice captive, for he knew that speaking out could endanger not only himself but also the fragile hope that flickered within the imprisoned wizard.

Raindrops mingled with the young man's uncertainty as he continued his silent vigil, a silent observer in this grim procession. His gaze met that of the tattooed man in the cage for a brief moment, a fleeting exchange that held the promise of a shared understanding. In that unspoken connection, the young man sensed a glimmer of something greater, a purpose that extended beyond the confines of their current circumstances.

And so, with each step taken through the rain-soaked landscape, the young man's determination grew. Deep within his heart, he vowed to uncover the truth that lay veiled within the enigmatic figure's tattooed skin. With every passing moment, the boundaries of trust would be tested, and the young man would discover the strength to navigate the delicate dance between loyalty and rebellion in this grim world of Inkoria.

The rain continued its relentless assault on the weary captives, its cold touch seeping into their bones, sapping their warmth. The tattooed prisoner, Aric, felt every raindrop like a taunting reminder of his confined existence. The iron cage, his prison, had become both sanctuary and torment, shielding him from the world  yet trapping in a relentless cycle of despair. His muscles cramped constantly in the confined space, a constant reminder of his predicament.

Days blurred together within the confines of the cage, the monotony broken only by the jangling of chains and the occasional creaking of the wooden wagon carrying them. Aric and his fellow captives endured the physical hardships of their confinement, their bodies growing weak and weary. The slop they were fed once a day provided meager sustenance, barely enough to stave off hunger. Water, rationed out sparingly, offered only a brief respite from parched throats.

Amidst this bleak existence, Pascoe moved with a gentle determination. Secured to his belt, a small leather pouch swung gently with step he took. It contained a collection of dried herbs and vials of soothing salves. His eyes swept over the imprisoned souls, his heart burdened by the suffering he witnessed. Wounds and ailments plagued the captives, the result of cramped quarters and the unforgiving nature of their circumstances. With unwavering resolve, Pascoe approached each captive, offering what solace he could.

Whenever the caravan made camp, Pascoe would inspect each of the seven prisoners, "Let me tend to your wounds," Pascoe's voice carried a gentle reassurance, his touch as tender as his words. He examined their injuries with a practiced eye, his hands moving with purpose and care. The captives, battered and bruised, found a glimmer of hope in his presence, a flicker of compassion in this world devoid of mercy.

Aric watched Pascoe as he moved among the prisoners, his heart stirred by the healer’s kindness. He recognized the glint of a braid pendant, discreetly hidden within Pascoe's hair, as a symbol of faith and devotion.

The slavers, Tuval and his aid Brumur, Aric had heard them shouting at each other, watched Pascoe's actions with a mixture of indifference and annoyance. To them, the captives were nothing more than commodities to be sold and discarded. They cared little for the toll their confinement took on their bodies and spirits.

As the caravan pressed on through the relentless rain, its wheels churning through the muddy path, the journey to the city of Sandhaven seemed endless. Aric and his fellow captives yearned for freedom, their minds and bodies weary from their captivity. Pascoe, driven by a compassion that defied the harsh realities of their circumstances, continued to offer what comfort he could amidst the bleakness.
