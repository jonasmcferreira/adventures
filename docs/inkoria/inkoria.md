## Locations

### Sandhaven
 
Nestled along the sun-kissed shores of the Inkorian coast, Sandhaven emerges as a city of vibrant contrasts. Its bustling streets and lively markets teem with merchants, entertainers, and adventurers, painting a picture of a carefree coastal paradise. The honest half of the city boasts quaint seaside cottages, where hardworking fishermen return with their bountiful catches. Visitors can revel in the cheerful ambiance of seaside taverns, indulge in delectable seafood delicacies, and wander through art-filled promenades. However, as the sun sets and shadows grow longer, the other half of Sandhaven reveals a darker side. In dimly lit alleys and hidden backrooms, unsavory activities thrive. Slavers trade lives, pirates plot their next plunder, smugglers navigate secret passages, and gamblers wager fortunes. The city's dual nature creates a palpable tension, where pleasure and danger intermingle in a delicate dance, enticing the curious and daring alike.

### Obsidian Veil
 The Hidden City shrouded in Mystery Obsidian Veil is a city veiled in secrecy and perpetually concealed from prying eyes. This enigmatic city is the only place where spellcasting is allowed and practiced openly. However, its exact location remains a closely guarded secret, as the city possesses the unsettling ability to constantly shift its position. It is said that only those deemed worthy by the city's mystical guardians can find their way to its ever-changing gates. Obsidian Veil serves as a refuge for renegade spellcasters, a clandestine haven where they can hone their craft beyond the reach of witch-hunters.
    
### White Citadel
 The Seat of the Tyrant King White Citadel is a city gripped by tyranny, ruled with an iron fist by a malevolent king who has abolished spellcasting to maintain control over the populace. Dark and foreboding, the citadel exudes an aura of oppression and fear. The streets are filled with loyalist guards who enforce the king's decrees, suppressing any whispers of magic and quelling any signs of rebellion. The king's stronghold looms over the city, an imposing fortress from which he exerts his power and ensures the subjugation of his subjects.
        
### Ironhold
 The Industrial Citadel Ironhold stands as a grim testament to the relentless march of industry and the subjugation of nature. It is a city where the dark arts of alchemy and mechanical enchantments intertwine, giving rise to a mechanized society ruled by sinister engineers and arcane inventors. The air is thick with smog and the relentless clang of machinery. Ironhold is a hub of manufacturing and technological advancements fueled by the exploitation of forbidden knowledge. Its towering smokestacks belch forth toxic fumes, casting a perpetual pall over the city and its inhabitants.

## Magic

In Inkoria, magic is a rare and forbidden art. The practice of spellcasting is strictly prohibited, and those who possess magical abilities are considered dangerous and are actively hunted down. The ruling authorities have established an oppressive regime, seeking to eliminate any trace of magic from society.

Accessing magical powers requires intense study, discipline, and a natural affinity for the arcane. Only a select few individuals, known as "whisperers," have the potential to become spellcasters. These individuals possess an innate connection to the mystical energies of the world but must keep their abilities hidden to avoid persecution.

The government, fearing the potential chaos and disruption that magic may bring, has imposed severe penalties for anyone caught practicing or even harboring magical knowledge. Specialized units, known as the "Enforcers," have been formed to track down and capture spellcasters. These Enforcers are highly trained and employ various means to detect and suppress magical activity.

To survive in Inkoria, spellcasters must operate in secrecy, forming hidden societies or joining clandestine organizations that aim to protect and preserve magical knowledge. They develop covert methods of communication and share their abilities and teachings discreetly, all while constantly evading the watchful eyes of the authorities.

Despite the dangers and restrictions, some individuals are driven by their affinity for magic and the belief in its potential to bring about change. They become rebels, resisting the oppressive regime and fighting for the freedom to practice magic openly. These rebels often find themselves in a constant battle for survival, hiding in the shadows while attempting to overthrow the ruling order and restore the rightful place of magic in society.

In Inkoria, the absence of magic is pervasive, leaving the general populace unaware of its existence and the possibilities it holds. However, whispers of ancient texts, hidden artifacts, and legendary figures who wielded immense magical power still circulate among those who dare to seek the truth. The search for magic becomes a dangerous and clandestine quest, filled with treacherous journeys, secret alliances, and the constant threat of betrayal.

Overall, Inkoria portrays a bleak and oppressive society where the pursuit of magic is met with persecution and fear. Spellcasters are hunted down and forced to operate in secrecy, while the general populace remains oblivious to the potential wonders that magic can bring.

### Rules of Magic 

- Weaving spells costs fatigue to the Mage. Extensive spell weaving without some rest could cause the Mage to feel sick, very tired, to faint or die.
- Dead people can be brought back to life permanently, but only under very specific circumstances and the spells needed are quiet difficult to weave. A Deity must be involved.
- Weaving complex spells and combining a lot of Glyphs takes time. If, for example, I want to put a spell on a large area or a big building, I would have to weave a net of Glyphs all around and inside the place, and that takes a lot of time and preparation.
- Mages can create inanimate objects out of nothing but in order to keep it in the physical world for more than a few minutes the mage would need to use a lot of energy. The majority of magically created objects are temporary.
- There is a metal alloy called Black Rock that can block the flow of magic and block spell weaving. While another metal alloy called White Rock can store magical energy.
- The physical cost of weaving a spell is directly proportioned to how much the effects of the spell change the reality. An experienced mage will know how to make more effective glyphs, a transformation spell would be challenging but I would definitely succeed, while more exotic or big spells like making a mountain float or bringing dead to life, would need either multiple mages, white rocks or risk death.
- Weaving spells with blood is possible, but must be approached with caution.

## Deities

### Aeshara, the Veiled Guide

Aeshara, the Veiled Guide, is a deity revered by those who believe in the subtle power of manipulating circumstances from within, advocating for justice through cunning and strategy. Often depicted as a cloaked figure with a mysterious aura, Aeshara embodies the enigmatic nature of fate and the intricate web of interconnected destinies.

Aeshara's teachings revolve around the concept that sometimes the path to righteousness requires navigating through darkness and utilizing unconventional means to achieve a greater good. This deity believes that the world is a complex tapestry, and understanding the interplay of its threads is essential to effect change.

The Veiled Guide's followers believe that Aeshara guides them through the hidden alleys of life, challenging them to embrace complexity and moral ambiguity. While other deities may champion direct confrontation or overt displays of power, Aeshara urges subtlety and calculated action to achieve desired outcomes.

Aeshara's worshipers, often a select few who understand the delicate balance of power, honor their deity through acts of subversion, strategic alliances, and the protection of the vulnerable. They believe that by walking in the footsteps of the Veiled Guide, they can gradually unravel the threads of injustice and weave a tapestry of liberation and enlightenment for all who suffer under the weight of oppression.

### Vexar, the Discordant Shadow

Vexar, the Discordant Shadow, is a deity who represents chaos, disruption, and the subversion of established order. This enigmatic and unpredictable entity is the antithesis of Aeshara, the Veiled Guide, and embodies the forces that seek to undermine stability and thwart the careful plans of others.

Vexar's followers believe in embracing chaos as a catalyst for change, challenging the structures and systems that Aeshara's followers strive to uphold. The Discordant Shadow is often depicted as a swirling mass of shadowy tendrils, symbolizing the ever-shifting nature of disruption and the breaking of chains.

The teachings of Vexar reject the notion of adhering to rules, hierarchies, and predetermined paths. Instead, they emphasize the pursuit of personal freedom, even at the expense of societal order. Vexar's followers may engage in acts of rebellion, subversion, and the exploitation of loopholes to dismantle existing power structures.

In direct opposition to Aeshara, Vexar seeks to sow discord, undermine carefully laid plans, and challenge the status quo. The deity's divine message would often encourage followers to disrupt the plans and schemes of those aligned with Aeshara, emphasizing the importance of individual agency and the pursuit of personal desires over the greater good.

Vexar's worshipers revel in unpredictability and thrive in environments of chaos. They may employ deception, trickery, and manipulation to further their goals, constantly seeking to upset the balance and disrupt the well-laid plans of others. They believe that true liberation can only be achieved by dismantling the systems that confine and restrict individual potential.

In conflicts between the followers of Aeshara and Vexar, there would be an eternal struggle between order and chaos, strategy and spontaneity, and the belief in calculated plans versus the belief in the power of random chance. The clash between these deities would reflect a cosmic battle between those who seek to maintain stability and those who thrive on disruption and the constant reshaping of the world.
