## Locations

### Sandhaven
 
Nestled along the sun-kissed shores of the Inkorian coast, Sandhaven emerges as a city of vibrant contrasts. Its bustling streets and lively markets teem with merchants, entertainers, and adventurers, painting a picture of a carefree coastal paradise. The honest half of the city boasts quaint seaside cottages, where hardworking fishermen return with their bountiful catches. Visitors can revel in the cheerful ambiance of seaside taverns, indulge in delectable seafood delicacies, and wander through art-filled promenades. However, as the sun sets and shadows grow longer, the other half of Sandhaven reveals a darker side. In dimly lit alleys and hidden backrooms, unsavory activities thrive. Slavers trade lives, pirates plot their next plunder, smugglers navigate secret passages, and gamblers wager fortunes. The city's dual nature creates a palpable tension, where pleasure and danger intermingle in a delicate dance, enticing the curious and daring alike.

### Obsidian Veil
 The Hidden City shrouded in Mystery Obsidian Veil is a city veiled in secrecy and perpetually concealed from prying eyes. This enigmatic city is the only place where spellcasting is allowed and practiced openly. However, its exact location remains a closely guarded secret, as the city possesses the unsettling ability to constantly shift its position. It is said that only those deemed worthy by the city's mystical guardians can find their way to its ever-changing gates. Obsidian Veil serves as a refuge for renegade spellcasters, a clandestine haven where they can hone their craft beyond the reach of witch-hunters.
    
### White Citadel
 The Seat of the Tyrant King White Citadel is a city gripped by tyranny, ruled with an iron fist by a malevolent king who has abolished spellcasting to maintain control over the populace. Dark and foreboding, the citadel exudes an aura of oppression and fear. The streets are filled with loyalist guards who enforce the king's decrees, suppressing any whispers of magic and quelling any signs of rebellion. The king's stronghold looms over the city, an imposing fortress from which he exerts his power and ensures the subjugation of his subjects.
        
### Ironhold
 The Industrial Citadel Ironhold stands as a grim testament to the relentless march of industry and the subjugation of nature. It is a city where the dark arts of alchemy and mechanical enchantments intertwine, giving rise to a mechanized society ruled by sinister engineers and arcane inventors. The air is thick with smog and the relentless clang of machinery. Ironhold is a hub of manufacturing and technological advancements fueled by the exploitation of forbidden knowledge. Its towering smokestacks belch forth toxic fumes, casting a perpetual pall over the city and its inhabitants.
 
### Lumenwood Grove

Lumenwood Grove is a mystical forest where the lines between nature and magic blur, creating a space where the mundane world intertwines with the fantastic. Situated deep within the untamed wilderness of Inkoria, the grove is protected by a mystical barrier that shields it from prying eyes and hostile intentions. The forest is a riot of vibrant colors, teeming with bioluminescent flora and creatures that have been touched by magic.

The Lumenwood Grove is home to an array of mythical creatures, from gentle, healing unicorns and clever sprite-folk to the imposing treants and elusive phantoms. Each creature contributes to the grove's diverse ecosystem, ensuring the harmony between nature and magic persists. The forest is also known to contain various magical herbs and flowers, some of which are said to have potent healing properties, while others are used in the creation of powerful potions and spells.

The Grove is a sanctuary for mages seeking a safe haven from the world's oppressive regime. Here, they can practice magic openly, learning from the grove's inherent mysticism and the creatures that dwell within. Magic seems to permeate the very air of the forest, lending an aura of serenity and heightened energy to those attuned to its power.

Despite its tranquil exterior, Lumenwood Grove isn't without its dangers. Intruders who enter the forest with harmful intentions can find themselves lost in its labyrinthine trails, subjected to illusions, or even targeted by the forest's more territorial denizens. The Grove's magic tends to amplify the intentions of those who step into it, rewarding the pure-hearted and punishing those who bear malice.

### Virendale

The bustling capital city of Virendale is the political and economic heart of Inkoria, a city that never sleeps, thrumming with the energy of its inhabitants and the relentless pulse of commerce and diplomacy. The city's skyline is a mixture of grandeur and practicality, where ancient, stately edifices coexist with modern structures of steel and glass.

The city's districts are as diverse as its populace, ranging from the opulent quarters of the nobility and wealthy merchants to the packed and winding streets of the common folk's neighborhoods. Markets overflow with goods from across the land, and the sounds of bartering merchants form a constant backdrop. The city's dockyards are alive with the activity of trade ships loading and unloading their wares, further testament to Virendale's commercial significance.

Virendale's grand palace stands as the epicenter of political power, where the rulers enact laws and discuss diplomatic matters. Despite the oppression in other parts of Inkoria, Virendale thrives due to its strict laws and efficient enforcement, although corruption and power struggles are not unheard of.

The city is also a melting pot of cultures, as traders, diplomats, and adventurers from all over Inkoria and beyond gather here, making it a place where new ideas are exchanged, and alliances are forged. Despite the city's bustling exterior, Virendale is also a place of secrets and intrigue, where spies and assassins lurk in the shadows, and power plays are as common as trade deals.

### The Shatterpeaks

The Shatterpeaks, a vast and treacherous mountain range, forms a formidable natural barrier in Inkoria. The peaks are known for their dangerous trails, unpredictable weather, and hostile creatures. Yet, despite these challenges, the mountains are a destination for adventurers and treasure seekers due to the ancient rumors of powerful magical artifacts hidden within their depths.

Legends speak of the Shatterpeaks being the final battleground of the Great Mage War, a conflict of unprecedented scale between powerful mages that reshaped the landscape. After the dust settled, it's said that the magic-infused artifacts used in the war were sealed in hidden vaults throughout the mountains to prevent them from causing further destruction.

The artifacts are said to be of immense power, from orbs capable of controlling the elements to staffs that can resurrect the dead. But the path to these treasures is fraught with peril. The mountains are riddled with ancient wards and traps, designed to deter unwelcome visitors. Monsters and other magical abominations, residual creations of the Mage War, prowl the craggy slopes and deep caverns, ready to pounce on unsuspecting trespassers.

Many brave or foolhardy explorers have attempted to penetrate the Shatterpeaks, drawn by the allure of the artifacts and the promise of power. However, few return, and those who do often come back maddened or transformed by their experiences. As such, the Shatterpeaks have gained a reputation as a place of great reward and equally great peril, a destination for only the most daring or desperate.

## Magic

In Inkoria, magic is a rare and forbidden art. The practice of spellcasting is strictly prohibited, and those who possess magical abilities are considered dangerous and are actively hunted down. The ruling authorities have established an oppressive regime, seeking to eliminate any trace of magic from society.

The government, fearing the potential chaos and disruption that magic may bring, has imposed severe penalties for anyone caught practicing or even harboring magical knowledge. Specialized units, known as the "Enforcers," have been formed to track down and capture spellcasters. These Enforcers are highly trained and employ various means to detect and suppress magical activity.

To survive in Inkoria, spellcasters must operate in secrecy, forming hidden societies or joining clandestine organizations that aim to protect and preserve magical knowledge. They develop covert methods of communication and share their abilities and teachings discreetly, all while constantly evading the watchful eyes of the authorities.

In Inkoria, the absence of magic is pervasive, leaving the general populace unaware of its existence and the possibilities it holds. However, whispers of ancient texts, hidden artifacts, and legendary figures who wielded immense magical power still circulate among those who dare to seek the truth. The search for magic becomes a dangerous and clandestine quest, filled with treacherous journeys, secret alliances, and the constant threat of betrayal.

Overall, Inkoria portrays a bleak and oppressive society where the pursuit of magic is met with persecution and fear. Spellcasters are hunted down and forced to operate in secrecy, while the general populace remains oblivious to the potential wonders that magic can bring.

### System

In the world of Inkoria, the source of all magic is a mystical, mineral-like substance known as Essentia. There are six types of Essentia, each associated with a particular element and possessing a unique color

Verdantium (Wood - Green)

Manifests during vibrant storms in ancient, untouched forests. Harvesters, known as Greenfinders, brave the tempests to gather the Verdantium that falls like hail, embedded in the fallen leaves and branches.

Rubicite (Fire - Red)

Born from the great volcanic eruptions or wildfires, creating fiery storms. The Ashseekers don these storms, gathering Rubicite from the ashes once the flame subsides.

Terraglaze (Earth - Brown)

Unearthed after the ground-shaking storms caused by earthquakes or landslides. Earthcutters venture into the destabilized terrain, retrieving Terraglaze from the fractured earth.

Argentscale (Metal - Silver)

Formed during metallic storms within the deep mines or caverns. Miners, or Silvergraspers, find Argentscale clinging to the rock walls after these storms.

Azurite (Water - Blue)

Found glittering like sea glass among the pebbles on riverbanks or beaches after aquatic storms. Collectors, known as Wavetreaders, scavenge for Azurite washed up by the tide.

Grisen (Inert - Gray)

Scattered around as dull-looking pebbles following the rare and uncanny storms, tied to solar and lunar eclipses. Eclipsers, those with the thankless job, gather the seemingly ordinary Grisen stones in these special events.

#### Currency

In their raw form, each Essentia type can be used as a form of currency, their value determined by their rarity and size.

Dust, the smallest particles, are commonly used by the poor and for minor transactions.
Chips, a bit larger, are the most common currency form, used in everyday transactions.
Shards and slabs, larger and more rare, are primarily used for significant purchases, hoarding wealth, or as offerings to the elite.
Magical Use

When processed, the Essentia can be used to create magical inks. These inks, when used to draw symbols or tattoo the skin, can imbue an individual with various magical abilities or effects. The type of Essentia used in the ink determines the kind of power imbued - Verdantium might promote growth or healing, Rubicite could command fire, and so on.

Not everyone in Inkoria can utilize the power of Essentia. This ability is limited to a select few, the 'Inked', often restricted by factors such as prestige, social status, heredity, or genetics. These Inked individuals, bearing the intricate tattoos of Essentia ink, are both revered and feared, making magic a rare and highly-regulated practice in Inkoria.

#### Generation

The formation of Essentia is closely tied to the elemental occurrences or natural phenomena in Inkoria.

Verdantium

These green stones are formed during storms that arise in the ancient, undisturbed forests of Inkoria. The violent winds and the force of nature at work during these tempests cause a strange transmutation in the leaves and branches, changing them into the Verdantium stones.

Rubicite

The fiery storms created from volcanic eruptions and raging wildfires cause a mysterious alchemical change in the ashes left behind, forming Rubicite.

Terraglaze

When seismic activities, like earthquakes and landslides, happen, they disrupt the earth and cause ground-shaking storms. As the dust settles, pieces of earth and rock have transmuted into Terraglaze.

Argentscale

The metallic storms that whip through the deepest mines and caverns leave behind Argentscale, seemingly coalescing from the disturbed minerals and metals inside the earth.

Azurite

During the aquatic storms that rage across the sea or great rivers, some of the water transforms into Azurite, a process still unexplained by the scholars of Inkoria.

Grisen

The inert Essentia, Grisen, is formed during solar and lunar eclipses. The alignment of celestial bodies causes a temporary distortion in reality that results in the creation of Grisen stones.

#### Harvesting

Essentia harvesters, given various names depending on the type of Essentia they collect, must demonstrate courage and determination to face these elemental storms. Each harvesting process is unique, and the methods used vary greatly

Verdantium

Greenfinders use special tools, often made from bone and wood, to extract Verdantium stones from the broken leaves and branches without causing them to shatter.

Rubicite

Ashseekers, using long, heat-resistant tongs, collect Rubicite from the still-smoldering remains of firestorms. It's a risky profession, often performed while wearing protective clothing to ward off the heat and fumes.

Terraglaze

Earthcutters must navigate unstable terrain after an earth-shaking storm. They use digging tools and careful handiwork to extract Terraglaze from the fractured earth.

Argentscale

Silvergraspers are often miners equipped with hammers and chisels, carefully chipping away Argentscale from the rock walls while ensuring not to cause a cave-in.

Azurite

Wavetreaders walk the shores after an aquatic storm, armed with scoop nets and sifting pans, to collect the water-transformed Azurite.

Grisen

Eclipsers, using simple collection bags, gather the Grisen stones during the rare solar and lunar eclipses. Their job is simpler, as Grisen merely lies scattered around after these special events.

### Rules of Magic 

In the world of Inkoria, the art of spellcasting comes with certain rules and limitations that govern its practice. These rules shape the boundaries and consequences of magic, ensuring that its power is not wielded recklessly.

1. **Fatigue and Rest**

Weaving spells consumes the Mage's energy and vitality. Extensive spellcasting without proper rest can lead to physical consequences such as sickness, extreme fatigue, fainting, or even death. Mages must listen to their bodies and take care to replenish their strength.

2. **Resurrection**

Bringing the dead back to life is a complex and challenging endeavor. It requires intricate spells and the involvement of a deity. Only under specific circumstances, with the deity's blessing and guidance, can a deceased individual be permanently revived.

3. **Complex Spells and Time**

Weaving powerful and intricate spells takes time and meticulous preparation. For spells that affect large areas or structures, a mage must create a network of carefully crafted Glyphs both inside and around the intended target. This process demands patience, precision, and ample time for the weaving to be successful.

4. **Temporary Creations**

Mages have the ability to conjure inanimate objects out of thin air. However, these magical creations are typically temporary, fading away after a few minutes unless sustained by a significant expenditure of the mage's energy.

## Faith

Lightbringers

These clerics draw their power from the gods associated with light, illumination, and purity. They are the beacons of hope in the darkness, wielding radiant magic to dispel shadows and bring enlightenment to the oppressed. Lightbringers inspire others with their unwavering faith and provide guidance and solace to those who have lost their way.

Shadowseekers

These clerics walk a more mysterious and enigmatic path, attuned to the gods associated with darkness, secrecy, and subterfuge. They are adept at navigating the hidden realms and gathering information from the shadows. Shadowseekers use their powers to protect the innocent, expose corruption, and unravel the secrets that shroud Inkoria's dark underbelly.

Lifekeepers

The Lifekeepers draw their strength from the gods associated with nature, healing, and vitality. They are dedicated healers, both in body and spirit, using their divine magic to mend wounds, cure ailments, and bring life to barren places. Lifekeepers provide care and compassion to the downtrodden, bringing hope and renewal to a world plagued by suffering.

Stormcallers

These clerics are connected to the gods associated with storms, weather, and elemental forces. They command the powers of lightning, thunder, and wind, using them to protect the weak and challenge the oppressive rule. Stormcallers are fierce and passionate, bringing the wrath of nature upon those who abuse their power.

Fateweavers

The clerics who embody the aspect of Fateweavers are attuned to the gods associated with destiny, time, and prophecy. They possess the ability to glimpse the threads of fate and shape the outcomes of events. Fateweavers serve as guardians of balance, ensuring that the true path is followed and that injustice is met with consequences.

## Deities

### Aeshara, the Veiled Guide

Aeshara, the Veiled Guide, is a deity revered by those who believe in the subtle power of manipulating circumstances from within, advocating for justice through cunning and strategy. Often depicted as a cloaked figure with a mysterious aura, Aeshara embodies the enigmatic nature of fate and the intricate web of interconnected destinies.

Aeshara's teachings revolve around the concept that sometimes the path to righteousness requires navigating through darkness and utilizing unconventional means to achieve a greater good. This deity believes that the world is a complex tapestry, and understanding the interplay of its threads is essential to effect change.

The Veiled Guide's followers believe that Aeshara guides them through the hidden alleys of life, challenging them to embrace complexity and moral ambiguity. While other deities may champion direct confrontation or overt displays of power, Aeshara urges subtlety and calculated action to achieve desired outcomes.

Aeshara's worshipers, often a select few who understand the delicate balance of power, honor their deity through acts of subversion, strategic alliances, and the protection of the vulnerable. They believe that by walking in the footsteps of the Veiled Guide, they can gradually unravel the threads of injustice and weave a tapestry of liberation and enlightenment for all who suffer under the weight of oppression.

### Vexar, the Discordant Shadow

Vexar, the Discordant Shadow, is a deity who represents chaos, disruption, and the subversion of established order. This enigmatic and unpredictable entity is the antithesis of Aeshara, the Veiled Guide, and embodies the forces that seek to undermine stability and thwart the careful plans of others.

Vexar's followers believe in embracing chaos as a catalyst for change, challenging the structures and systems that Aeshara's followers strive to uphold. The Discordant Shadow is often depicted as a swirling mass of shadowy tendrils, symbolizing the ever-shifting nature of disruption and the breaking of chains.

The teachings of Vexar reject the notion of adhering to rules, hierarchies, and predetermined paths. Instead, they emphasize the pursuit of personal freedom, even at the expense of societal order. Vexar's followers may engage in acts of rebellion, subversion, and the exploitation of loopholes to dismantle existing power structures.

In direct opposition to Aeshara, Vexar seeks to sow discord, undermine carefully laid plans, and challenge the status quo. The deity's divine message would often encourage followers to disrupt the plans and schemes of those aligned with Aeshara, emphasizing the importance of individual agency and the pursuit of personal desires over the greater good.

Vexar's worshipers revel in unpredictability and thrive in environments of chaos. They may employ deception, trickery, and manipulation to further their goals, constantly seeking to upset the balance and disrupt the well-laid plans of others. They believe that true liberation can only be achieved by dismantling the systems that confine and restrict individual potential.

In conflicts between the followers of Aeshara and Vexar, there would be an eternal struggle between order and chaos, strategy and spontaneity, and the belief in calculated plans versus the belief in the power of random chance. The clash between these deities would reflect a cosmic battle between those who seek to maintain stability and those who thrive on disruption and the constant reshaping of the world.
