- I am writing a novel on the world of Inkoria. 
- Inkoria is a world where the written word is power.
- Spellcasting is illegal, there are inquisitors everywhere called Marktrackers, who hunt down tattooed individuals calling them "Marked".
- Tattoos are more than mere adornments; they are conduits to the primal forces that shape the world. 
- Each tattoo represents a unique aspect, element, or intention, crafted with meticulous care and imbued with the inherent magic of Inkoria. 
- Spells only work if tattooed on a person, and the knowledge is passed from apprentice to apprentice in secret.
