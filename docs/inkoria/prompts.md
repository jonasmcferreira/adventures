- I am writing a novel on the world of Inkoria. 
- Inkoria is a world where the written word is power.
- Spellcasting is illegal, there are inquisitors everywhere called Marktrackers, who hunt down tattooed individuals calling them "Marked".
- Tattoos are more than mere adornments; they are conduits to the primal forces that shape the world. 
- Each tattoo represents a unique aspect, element, or intention, crafted with meticulous care and imbued with the inherent magic of Inkoria. 
- Spells only work if tattooed on a person, and the knowledge is passed from apprentice to apprentice in secret.

## Plot outline

Introduction: The story begins with the wizard captured and the cleric as part of the escort assigned to transport the wizard to a specific location, such as a prison or a court for trial. The cleric's role in the escort is due to their position as a representative of their deity, tasked with ensuring justice is served.

Unfortunate Event: During the journey, an unfortunate event takes place, such as an ambush by bandits or an attack by magical creatures. The attack results in the death of the other members of the escort, leaving only the cleric and the wizard alive.

Forced Cooperation: In the aftermath of the attack, the cleric realizes that their chances of reaching their original destination safely are diminished without the aid of the wizard's magical abilities. Reluctantly, the cleric decides to capture the wizard and form an uneasy alliance, believing it is necessary for their own survival and the completion of their mission.

The Journey Begins: The cleric and the wizard set off on a perilous journey together. As they travel through dangerous territories, they encounter various challenges, adversaries, and obstacles that test their skills, resilience, and ability to trust one another.

Shared Experiences: During their shared experiences, the cleric begins to witness the wizard's true character, their struggles, and the unfairness of their capture. Through conversations and moments of vulnerability, the wizard reveals their motivations, their perspective on magic, and the injustices they have witnessed under the oppressive regime.

Shifting Perspectives: The cleric's initial skepticism and prejudice gradually give way to empathy and understanding. They start questioning the validity of the prohibition on magic, the motivations of the regime, and the true nature of justice. The cleric's growing connection with the wizard and the realization of the wizard's inherent goodness begin to change their heart and beliefs.

A Common Cause: As the journey progresses, the cleric and the wizard discover evidence of a greater conspiracy or threat that affects both the lower pantheons and the higher pantheons of gods. They realize that their individual quests for justice and freedom are intertwined, and they share a common cause to challenge the oppressive regime and restore balance to Inkoria.

Transformation and Alliance: The cleric undergoes a significant transformation, embracing a new perspective on magic, power, and their role as a servant of their deity. They forge a true alliance with the wizard, working together to expose the conspiracy, rally support, and gather allies from both the lower and higher pantheons.

Climactic Confrontation: The story culminates in a climactic confrontation with the leaders of the oppressive regime. With their newfound unity, the cleric and the wizard lead a rebellion against the unjust rule, using their combined strengths to fight against the regime's forces and to challenge the control of the higher pantheons.

Resolution and Rebirth: The story ends with the overthrow of the oppressive regime and the restoration of a more balanced and just society in Inkoria. The cleric's journey of transformation is complete, having undergone a profound shift in beliefs and values. The wizard is recognized not as a criminal but as a symbol of resilience and the potential of magic, with their abilities embraced rather than feared.

This story arc allows for a gradual evolution of the cleric's perspective, as they undergo personal growth and realize the injustices inherent in the prohibition on magic. Their interaction with the wizard serves as a catalyst for change, leading to a united front against the oppressive regime and a greater understanding of the need for balance and justice in Inkoria.
