I am writing a novel on the world of Inkoria. 
Inkoria is a world where the written word is power.
a sense of darkness looms over the cities In the White Citadel, the king's oppressive rule forbids spellcasting, enforcing control over the populace.

Spellcasting is illegal, there are inquisitors everywhere called Marktrackers, who hunt down tattooed individuals calling them "Marked".
Tattoos are more than mere adornments; they are conduits to the primal forces that shape the world. Each tattoo represents a unique aspect, element, or intention, crafted with meticulous care and imbued with the inherent magic of Inkoria. Spells only work if tattooed on a person, and the knowledge is passed from apprentice to apprentice in secret.
