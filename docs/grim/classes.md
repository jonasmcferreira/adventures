## Blade

In a world cloaked in darkness, the Blade stands firmâ€”a warrior unbroken by the grim reality that surrounds them. From the savage heart of the barbarian to the disciplined mind of the soldier, they embody resilience and strength. Armed and ready, the Blade faces horrors that would break lesser spirits, their resolve as sharp as their weapon. In the bleakness, they are a necessary force, fighting not just for glory, but for survival. Their story is one of courage in the face of certain doom, a steadfast shield against the tide of chaos.

If you're drawn to the heart of melee combat, relishing the clash of steel and the thrill of close-quarters battle, then the Blade is your calling. This class is designed for players who want to be at the forefront of the fray, wielding power and resilience as their weapons. As a Blade, you'll master the art of combat, from the precise strikes of a duelist to the brute force of a barbarian. You're not just a fighter; you're a protector and a warrior, ready to face whatever darkness lies ahead. Choose the Blade if you're ready to stand as a beacon of strength in a world that desperately needs it.
