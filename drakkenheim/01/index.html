<h1 id="day-01">Day 01</h1>
<h2 id="the-brawl-with-old-rattlecan">The Brawl with Old Rattlecan</h2>
<p>In the cozy, yet somewhat rugged interior of the Skull and Sword Tavern, Lord Eldrin Blackwood, Kaelor Quickbreath, Grekson, and Tukuy Pachamama were deep in discussion about their foray into Drakkenheim. The tavern was abuzz with the energy of adventurers and townsfolk, all reveling in the brief respite from the harsh realities outside.</p>
<p>"We need to be cautious," Eldrin said, his voice low. "The streets of Drakkenheim are treacherous, littered with both visible and unseen dangers."</p>
<p>Grekson nodded, his eyes serious. "I know a few safe passages, but we'll need to be prepared for anything. Delirium's effects are unpredictable."</p>
<p>Kaelor, ever the optimist, leaned back in his chair. "As long as we stick together and watch each other's backs, we'll make it through. Be wary though as there's a lot of ratling roaming about, and the abominations from Delerium are at every corner".</p>
<p>Eldrin was mid-sentence when a raucous cheer erupted from a group of ruffians at a nearby table. "Oi, you lot!" one of them called out, sloshing his drink. "Fancy a kick at the ol' Rattlecan?"</p>
<p>Kaelor raised an eyebrow, a grin spreading across his feline face. "Rattlecan? That old suit of armor? I've heard tales, but I thought it was just an ale-fueled myth."</p>
<p>Grekson chuckled, leaning back in his chair. "Oh, it's real alright. A favorite pastime here is to challenge that animated heap of metal to a duel. It's like a rite of passage for the local drunkards."</p>
<p>Before they could decline the offer, a sudden clanging of metal drew their attention outside. "Aha! Take that!" shouted a metallic voice, followed by a series of boastful taunts like "Ha! 'Tis but a flesh wound!" and "Was that the best you can do?"</p>
<p>Curiosity piqued, the four companions made their way outside, where they witnessed a bizarre spectacle. Old Rattlecan, the animated suit of armor, was engaged in a clumsy yet spirited battle with two overconfident ruffians.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/01-rattlecan.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="rattlecan" src="../images/01-rattlecan.png" /></a></p>
<p>The armor moved with surprising agility for something that looked like it belonged in a scrapyard. "Have at thee!" it bellowed, swinging a gauntleted fist at the nearest ruffian.</p>
<p>Kaelor leaned against the tavern wall, watching the fight with amusement. "Well, I've seen many things, but a trash-talking suit of armor is a first."</p>
<p>Tukuy folded his arms, observing the scene. "It fights with more honor than its challengers, that's for sure."</p>
<p>The brawl was both comical and chaotic. One ruffian tried to tackle the armor, only to bounce off with a groan. The other swung wildly, missing more often than hitting. Old Rattlecan, seemingly enjoying the fray, danced around them, landing thumping blows.</p>
<p>"Ouch, that's got to hurt," Grekson winced as one ruffian took a solid hit to the stomach, doubling over.</p>
<p>The fight reached its climax when the armor knocked one ruffian unconscious with a well-aimed punch. The remaining combatant, however, managed to find a weak spot in Rattlecan's back, causing it to stagger and eventually collapse in a heap, pieces scattering across the street.</p>
<p>The victorious ruffian, panting and bruised, spat on the ground and staggered away, leaving the defeated armor behind.</p>
<p>Eldrin stepped forward, inspecting the fallen Rattlecan. "Remarkable. Even in defeat, it retains a sense of dignity."</p>
<p>Kaelor picked up a detached gauntlet, examining it with a mix of respect and curiosity. "Well, it seems Old Rattlecan has been disarmed," he quipped, eliciting a groan from Eldrin.</p>
<p>Tukuy shook his head, chuckling. "Only in Emberwood would you find such entertainment. But let's not forget our purpose here."</p>
<p>As the group returned to the tavern, Old Rattlecan, in a display of magical resilience, began to reassemble itself. Within moments, the suit of armor stood upright, its metallic frame glinting under the tavern's dim lights, seemingly awaiting a new challenger.</p>
<p>The tavern's lively chatter was interrupted as a boisterous voice cut through the air. "Oi, you lot! Fancy a real challenge?" A stout dwarf, flanked by a sly-looking kobold and a tall human, gestured towards the adventurers and Old Rattlecan.</p>
<p>Eldrin turned, a competitive glint in his eye. "A challenge, you say? We're listening."</p>
<p>The dwarf chuckled, stroking his thick beard. "Simple. First group to knock down Rattlecan wins. One gold coin says we drop it before you do."</p>
<p>Eldrin's smirk widened. "Make it five gold coins. We never back down from a challenge."</p>
<p>The dwarf's eyes sparkled with amusement. "Ten gold coins it is, then! Let's see what you're made of!"</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/01-dwarf.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="dwarf" src="../images/01-dwarf.png" /></a></p>
<p>Kaelor stepped forward, cracking his knuckles. "Well, this just got interesting. Shall we show them how it's done?"</p>
<p>Grekson nodded, his hand resting on the hilt of his dagger. "I'm not one for gambling, but I do enjoy a good skirmish."</p>
<p>Tukuy, standing tall, flexed his muscles. "For ten gold coins, Rattlecan won't know what hit it."</p>
<p>As the two groups faced off, the atmosphere in the tavern shifted from festive to electric. Patrons gathered around, placing their own bets and cheering.</p>
<p>The dwarf's group took their positions, weapons at the ready. The human brandished a sword, the kobold wielded a set of daggers, and the dwarf hefted a hefty hammer.</p>
<p>Eldrin drew his sword with a flourish, Kaelor gripped his greataxe tightly, Grekson unsheathed his daggers with a swift motion, and Tukuy prepared to charge.</p>
<p>Old Rattlecan, seemingly aware of the stakes, adopted a defensive stance, its metallic voice booming, "Come then, challengers! Show me your mettle!"</p>
<p>With a nod from Eldrin, the two groups lunged forward, converging on the animated armor. The clanging of metal, shouts of effort, and the crowd's roars filled the air.</p>
<p>The scene was a chaotic dance of steel and strategy, each group trying to outmaneuver the other to land the decisive blow on Old Rattlecan. The adventurers' skills were matched only by their determination not to be outdone by their boisterous rivals.</p>
<p>The animated suit of armor, its movements clunky yet surprisingly effective, landed a hefty blow on one of the ruffians, sending him reeling backwards, stars dancing before his eyes.</p>
<p>Kaelor, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, leaped into action alongside Tukuy. "Time to dent some metal!" he exclaimed, swinging his axe with precision.</p>
<p>The Minotaur's muscles, honed from years of defending his tribe and battling the blight that plagued his lands, coiled like springs ready to unleash their power. With a roar that echoed through the village, Tukuy swung his arm, aiming a crushing blow at Old Rattlecan's torso. The impact resounded with a metallic clang that sent vibrations through the air. The force of the strike was so immense that it caused the armor to stagger backward, its structure rattling as if it would come apart at any moment.</p>
<p>The crowd erupted in cheers and gasps, their excitement reaching a fever pitch. Kaelor couldn't help but shout, "That's it, Tukuy! Show that pile of bolts what Minotaur strength is all about!"</p>
<p>With a resounding clang, Kaelor's axe struck Rattlecan, leaving a sizable dent in its chest. Tukuy followed with a powerful blow, bending the armor's helm.</p>
<p>The dwarf from the opposing team, watching the action with a mix of admiration and frustration, shouted, "Oi, no spells on Rattlecan, by the way!" He then lunged forward, his hammer sweeping at Rattlecan's legs in a deft arc.</p>
<p>Lord Eldrin, inspired by the sacred flame of his faith, called upon his divine powers. "By the light of the Sacred Flame, let our blows be guided!" he intoned, his voice resonating with a celestial harmony.</p>
<p>A warm, radiant light enveloped Grekson, Tukuy, and Kaelor, each feeling a surge of divine energy coursing through them. Grekson's daggers gleamed with a holy light, Tukuy's muscles seemed to swell with holy vigor, and Kaelor's eyes sparkled with an ethereal fire.</p>
<p>"Now that's what I call divine intervention!" Kaelor quipped, his axe swinging with renewed force.</p>
<p>The trio, now imbued with the blessing of the sacred flame, pounced on Old Rattlecan with a ferocity that was both awe-inspiring and terrifying. The animated armor, overwhelmed by the onslaught, succumbed to the relentless barrage. With a final, echoing crash, it collapsed into a heap of battered metal.</p>
<p>The crowd around them erupted into cheers and applause, the excitement palpable in the air. The dwarf, his expression a mix of shock and respect, walked over to Lord Eldrin. With a hearty slap on the back that nearly sent Eldrin stumbling, he planted a kiss on Eldrin's cheek.</p>
<p>"By the beards of my ancestors, that was the finest brawl I've seen in ages!" he exclaimed, his voice booming with laughter.</p>
<p>Eldrin, rubbing his cheek and trying to hide a smile, responded, "Well, it seems Old Rattlecan met its match today. But your enthusiasm is... quite infectious."</p>
<p>As the dust settled and the excitement of the duel with Old Rattlecan began to wane, the dwarf, with a grandiose flourish that seemed almost comical given his stout stature, he pulled out a small pouch and counted out ten gold coins into Eldrin's palm.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/01-coins.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/01-coins.png" /></a></p>
<p>"Fair's fair," the dwarf said with a nod. "You lot fought well. But since you're heading to Drakkenheim, let me offer you a wee bit of advice—stay away from Slaughterstone Square."</p>
<p>Eldrin raised an eyebrow, the coins clinking in his hand. "Slaughterstone Square? That sounds ominous."</p>
<p>The dwarf leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Oh, it's more than ominous, my lord. It's a right nightmare. The place is cursed, they say. Haunted by the ghosts of those who perished there. Best to steer clear if you value your sanity."</p>
<p>Grekson, who had been quietly observing the exchange, couldn't resist chiming in with his characteristic dry wit. "But it has such a lovely warm name to it," he quipped, a smirk playing on his lips. "Sounds like the perfect spot for a picnic, doesn't it?"</p>
<p>Kaelor burst into laughter, his booming voice filling the tavern. "Yes, and perhaps after our picnic, we can take a leisurely stroll through the 'Valley of Eternal Screams.' I hear it's lovely this time of year."</p>
<p>Tukuy, not usually one for humor, cracked a small smile at the banter. "And let's not forget to visit the 'Pit of Despair.' I hear the view is to die for."</p>
<p>The dwarf, caught off guard by the barrage of jokes, chuckled despite himself. "You're a funny lot. But mark my words, there's nothing funny about Slaughterstone Square. You'd do well to remember that."</p>
<p>Eldrin nodded, pocketing the gold coins. "Your advice is noted and appreciated. We'll be sure to pack extra sandwiches for our picnic in the square."</p>
<p>The group erupted into laughter, the tension of the earlier battle dissipating into the warm camaraderie of the moment. Lord Eldrin Blackwood, holding the ten gold coins in his palm, turbed to his companions, a look of genuine appreciation in his eyes. </p>
<p>With deliberate movements, Eldrin separated three coins and handed them to Grekson. "For your cunning and swiftness," he said, his voice imbued with respect. Eldrin then turned to Kaelor, extending another three coins. "For your strength and bravery, Kaelor. Your axe swings as fiercely as your spirit." Finally, Eldrin presented the last three coins to Tukuy. "And for you, Tukuy, for your unwavering resolve and mighty tree truks for arms."</p>
<p>With one coin remaining, Eldrin held it up, the light reflecting off its surface. "I am nothing without you all. Together, we are more than just adventurers seeking fortune. We are a fellowship bound by a common cause."</p>
<p>Kaelor, his feline eyes sparkling. "Ah, but remember, Lord Eldrin, it's not the gold that makes the warrior. Though, it does buy a fine round of ale," he chuckled, his tail swishing in amusement.</p>
<p>As Eldrin pocketed the last coin, they returned inside, and the tavern around them continued its lively bustle, oblivious to the significance of the moment. Yet for the four companions, it was a reaffirmation of their unity and purpose, a beacon of light in the shadowed path that lay ahead.</p>
<h2 id="the-silver-order-asks-for-a-favor">The silver order asks for a favor</h2>
<p>As the adventurers where about to settle to an evening of camraderie, they were approached by High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed of the Silver Order, accompanied by two cavaliers "Adventurers," Ophelia greeted them, her voice carrying a sense of urgency. "I have a task of utmost importance, one that cannot fall to just any hands."</p>
<p>Eldrin stepped forward, recognising the symbol identifyin Ophelia as a High Flamekeeeper of the Silver Order, curiosity piqued. "High Flamekeeper, we are at your service. What is this task you speak of?" Ophelia urged them to follow her.</p>
<p>As the evening shadows grew longer in Emberwood Village, casting an almost mystical glow over the rustic buildings, the companions found themselves outside the small but serene Chapel of the Sacred Flame. The circular fieldstone building, with its copper domed rooftop and thin stained glass windows, stood as a beacon of hope in the desolate landscape surrounding Drakkenheim. The simple wooden double doors of the chapel opened to a crematory garden and scattering plot, offering a peaceful resting place for the ashes of the departed.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/01-saint-ardenna.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/01-saint-ardenna.png" /></a></p>
<p>Inside the chapel, the bronze brazier of the Sacred Flame burned with a golden fire, its light flickering across the faces of those who sought solace within. Flamekeeper Hanna, a young woman in a simple white and yellow frock, her black hair neatly tied in a braid, tended to the flame. Despite her youth, she exuded a sense of calm wisdom, having taken the mantle of Flamekeeper after the death of her predecessor.</p>
<p>Ophelia, a figure of authority and dedication, had been attempting to persuade Hanna to join the Silver Order, but Hanna remained committed to her neutrality and service to the village.</p>
<p>Ophelia's eyes scanned the group, assessing their resolve. "The task concerns the Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio. It's been discovered that it lies buried beneath the Chapel of Saint Brenna. This artifact is of great significance and must not fall into the wrong hands."</p>
<p>Kaelor, leaning on his axe, chuckled. "Sounds like a treasure hunt. Count us in. But what's so special about this scepter?"</p>
<p>"The Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio is not just a relic; it's a symbol of the faith and power of the Sacred Flame. In the wrong hands, it could spell disaster," Ophelia explained. "Help us retrieve it, and you shall be handsomely rewarded for your efforts."</p>
<p>Grekson, ever the skeptic, raised an eyebrow. "And what's the catch? Such tasks are seldom without their dangers."</p>
<p>Ophelia nodded solemnly. "The race is on to recover the scepter. You won't be the only ones searching for it, and the others may not share our noble intentions."</p>
<p>Tukuy, his voice deep and steady, added, "We understand the risks. The Sacred Flame has guided us this far. We shall see this through."</p>
<p>Ophelia offered a grateful smile. "Meet me back at Camp Dawn once you have the scepter. Time is of the essence."</p>
<p>As the group prepared to leave, Hanna approached them. "May the Sacred Flame light your path and protect you in the shadows of Drakkenheim."</p>
<p>With their new task at hand, the companions stepped out of the chapel, the weight of their mission settling upon them. The Chapel of Saint Brenna and the Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio awaited, shrouded in mystery and danger.</p>
<p>As they walked away from the chapel, Kaelor quipped, "Well, looks like we're going from kicking cans to chasing scepters. What's next? Dragon-slaying?"</p>
<p>Grekson smirked. "Let's stick to scepters for now. Dragons can wait."</p>
<p>The group shared a light-hearted laugh, their spirits bolstered by the camaraderie and the challenge ahead. As they set off towards their next adventure, the Chapel of Saint Ardenna faded into the background, a silent witness to the beginning of their quest.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-expedition">The first expedition</h2>
<p>As the group gathered at the outskirts of Drakkenheim, the fallen city loomed before them, its broken spires and crumbling walls a haunting reminder of the catastrophe that had befallen it. The air was heavy with the eerie silence that enveloped the city, punctuated only by the distant cries of unknown creatures.</p>
<p>As they cautiously made their way through the desolate streets, they came across the corpse of a horse. Despite the passage of time, the body was eerily well-preserved, a testament to the bizarre effects of the Delirium that permeated the city.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/01-horse.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/01-horse.png" /></a></p>
<p>Kaelor, ever the opportunist, approached the carcass with a mischievous glint in his eyes. "Well, what do we have here? Dinner, anyone?"</p>
<p>Grekson looked at him incredulously. "You're not seriously considering... I mean, we're in a cursed city, and you want to scavenge a dead horse?"</p>
<p>Tukuy, his face a mask of skepticism, added, "Even if it's not decayed, it's still a dead horse in a place like this. I doubt it's going to be a gourmet meal."</p>
<p>Kaelor, undeterred, drew his knife. "You'll be surprised. A little bit of Leonin culinary magic, and you won't even remember where it came from."</p>
<p>Eldrin, trying to mask his amusement, chimed in. "I suppose it's better than the rations we've been living off. But if I start neighing in my sleep, I'm blaming you, Kaelor."</p>
<p>As Kaelor skillfully began to carve out portions of the horse, the others watched in a mix of horror and fascination. To their surprise, the meat appeared fresh, untainted by the passage of time.</p>
<p>"See? Nothing to worry about," Kaelor declared triumphantly, holding up a sizable cut. "Who's ready for some Emberwood-style horse steaks?"</p>
<p>Grekson, still skeptical, remarked dryly, "Well, when in Drakkenheim, do as the cursed do, I suppose."</p>
<p>Tukuy, inspecting the meat, gave a reluctant nod. "It's certainly a first for me. Eating horse in a fallen city. This journey keeps getting more interesting."</p>
<p>As they prepared to cook the scavenged meat, the bizarre nature of their situation wasn't lost on them. Here they were, a group of adventurers, about to dine on horse meat in the midst of a city shrouded in mystery and danger.</p>
<p>Eldrin, watching the preparations, mused aloud, "Who would have thought? Our first meal in Drakkenheim, and it's a feast fit for a king. Albeit a very strange king."</p>
<p>Their laughter echoed through the empty streets, a brief moment of lightness in the shadow of the city's haunting presence. The horse steaks, much to their surprise, turned out to be surprisingly palatable, a small but welcome comfort as they braced themselves for the challenges ahead in the ruins of Drakkenheim.</p>
<h2 id="rattling-ambush">Rattling ambush</h2>
<p>The brief respite enjoyed by the adventurers, brought on by the unexpected feast of horse meat, was abruptly interrupted. The aroma of the cooked meat wafted through the desolate streets of Drakkenheim, an irresistible lure to unwelcome visitors. From the shadows emerged a horde of ratlings, their beady eyes fixated on the meal and the group.</p>
<p>Kaelor, his eyes lighting up with excitement, unsheathed his axe with a grin. "Finally, some action! Let's see how these ratfolk like a bit of Leonin hunting."</p>
<p>The ratlings, scrawny and vicious, scurried towards the group with a menacing hiss. They were no match for the seasoned adventurers, but their numbers and ferocity posed a real threat.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/01-rattlings.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/01-rattlings.png" /></a></p>
<p>As the ratlings swarmed, Kaelor entered a battle frenzy, a glimmering layer of magical protection enveloping him. One ratling, overzealous in its attack, lunged at Kaelor, only to have its head explode upon contact with the shimmering barrier. "Ha! Didn't see that coming, did you?" Kaelor roared, swinging his axe with wild abandon. "Who ordered the rat kebab? Because I'm serving them up hot!"</p>
<p>Lord Eldrin, ever the tactician, raised his shield to direct the ratlings' attention, effectively protecting his companions from the brunt of the assault. "Focus on the shield! Let's keep them at bay," he commanded, his voice calm and authoritative amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>Tukuy, his massive form towering over the ratlings, used his horns with deadly precision, goring the creatures as they came within reach. His every move was a dance of power and fury, a testament to his strength and skill "In my village, we call this a pest control exercise.".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Grekson, with his crossbow in hand, dispatched several ratlings with expertly aimed bolts. Each shot was a display of his mastery, the bolts finding their mark with lethal efficiency. "And here I thought we'd have a quiet evening in Drakkenheim."</p>
<p>In mere moments, the ten ratlings lay defeated, their bodies scattered around the adventurers. The threat neutralized, the group took a moment to catch their breath, the adrenaline of the skirmish still coursing through their veins.</p>
<p>Kaelor, wiping ratling blood from his axe, chuckled. "Well, that was invigorating. Nothing like a good ratling hunt to get the blood pumping."</p>
<p>Eldrin nodded, sheathing his sword. "But let's not linger. This encounter has only solidified our resolve. We must head to our objective without further delay."</p>
<p>Tukuy and Grekson agreed, the former wiping his horns clean, the latter reloading his crossbow. The group quickly gathered their belongings, the sense of urgency now more pronounced.</p>
<p>As they set off deeper into the heart of Drakkenheim, the echo of their skirmish with the ratlings served as a stark reminder of the dangers lurking within the city. Their mission to recover the Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio was paramount, and they knew that distractions could prove costly. With renewed determination, they pressed on, each step taking them closer to the heart of the haunted city and the mysteries it held.</p>
<h2 id="the-chapel-of-saint-brenna">The chapel of Saint Brenna</h2>
<p>The Chapel of Saint Brenna stood isolated on a small hillock in the midst of a desolate residential borough of Drakkenheim. As the adventurers approached, the sight of the deteriorating chapel, with its partially collapsed domed slate roof and broken stained glass windows, set a somber tone. The melancholic atmosphere was palpable, a stark reminder of the city's tragic past.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/01-chapel-brenna.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/01-chapel-brenna.png" /></a></p>
<p>Kaelor gazed at the ruins. "This place feels like it's seen better days. And nights."</p>
<p>Grekson, scanning the surroundings, replied, "More than just days and nights. This chapel holds the history of a city and its people."</p>
<p>The group cautiously made their way through the rubble towards the arched double-door entrance, flanked by the remains of cylindrical towers. One tower lay in ruins, its stone rubble creating a breach into the chapel. The other tower, though standing, bore the scars of time and neglect.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the chapel grounds, they were greeted by a small terrace with stone benches and a sundial, leading to a walled garden to the east. The sight of the two soil plots, once sites for funeral pyres, and the statue of a plate-armoured woman holding a silver rod over her chest, added to the eerie quiet of the place.</p>
<p>Lord Eldrin pushed open the double doors, which creaked loudly, breaking the silence. "Be on your guard," he cautioned. "Places like this can hold more than just relics."</p>
<p>The interior of the chapel was a scene of decay and desolation. Brackish rainwater pooled in the basin created by the collapsed tower roof, and the once-hallowed space was now covered in dirt, dust, and debris. Faded frescoes of saints and martyrs adorned the walls between shattered windows, their once-vibrant colors dimmed by the passage of time.</p>
<p>In the three alcoves stood large statues, each marred by the elements. Saint Tarna battling a demonic entity, Saint Vitruvio in stoic vigil, and Saint Brenna performing her miracle of resurrection. Their stony gazes seemed to follow the adventurers as they moved through the chapel.</p>
<p>Tukuy, his voice a low rumble, observed, "The air here is heavy with more than just decay. It's as if the very walls mourn the loss of their purpose."</p>
<p>Scattered around the room were remnants of the chapel's past: ruined texts, iron braziers, and bronze lamps, some still hanging precariously from the timbers of the roof. The smell of bitumen hung thick in the air, adding to the oppressive feel of the place.</p>
<p>As they explored, Kaelor, his hand resting on the hilt of his axe, joked, "I always thought chapels were supposed to be places of peace and serenity. This one missed the memo."</p>
<p>Lord Eldrin approached the stone altar, his gaze fixed on the large bronze brazier. "This brazier... it was once a beacon of hope and faith. Now, it's just a hollow shell."</p>
<p>The group gathered near the altar, the sense of history and loss enveloping them. The Chapel of Saint Brenna, once a place of worship and community, now stood as a testament to the city's fall from grace.</p>
<p>Eldrin turned to his companions, determination in his eyes. "We came here for the Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio. Let's not forget our purpose amidst these ruins."</p>
<p>After an exhaustive search of the main chamber of the Chapel of Saint Brenna yielded nothing of note, the adventurers turned their attention to a narrow staircase descending into darkness. The air grew colder as they made their way down, the only sound their footsteps echoing off the stone walls.</p>
<p>At the bottom, they were met with an imposing iron gate blocking their path. The gate, rusted and forbidding, seemed to dare them to proceed further.</p>
<p>Eldrin, eyeing the gate, turned to Kaelor with a smirk. "Well, looks like we've found our next challenge. Care to do the honors?"</p>
<p>Kaelor cracked his knuckles and stepped forward. "I thought you'd never ask. Stand back and watch how it's done."</p>
<p>Just as Kaelor was about to swing his axe at the gate, Tukuy stepped in between them, his expression one of mild annoyance. "If you two are quite finished," he said, his deep voice echoing in the stairwell.</p>
<p>Before Eldrin or Kaelor could react, Tukuy grasped the gate with his massive hands. With a display of raw strength, he ripped the gate clean off its hinges, the sound of rending metal reverberating through the chamber.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/01-tukuy-gate.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/01-tukuy-gate.png" /></a></p>
<p>He then nonchalantly handed the gate to a stunned Eldrin and Kaelor. "There. Problem solved. Shall we continue?"</p>
<p>Eldrin, taking the gate from Tukuy, couldn't help but laugh. "Excellent lockpicking skills. Remind me never to get on your bad side, Tukuy."</p>
<p>Kaelor, equally amused, added, "I'll stick to the axe for now. But it's good to know we have a living battering ram on our team."</p>
<p>Grekson, who had been watching the exchange with an amused expression, chimed in, "Let's not forget why we're here. The scepter won't find itself."</p>
<p>With the path now clear, the adventurers proceeded into the depths beneath the chapel. The air grew damp and musty as they delved deeper, the sense of ancient secrets and hidden dangers growing with every step.</p>
<h2 id="devils">Devils</h2>
<p>Descending into the crypt beneath the Chapel of Saint Brenna, the adventurers found themselves in a chamber filled with an eerie stillness. Urns, clay pots, and painted vases, remnants of lives long passed, filled the alcoves cut into the walls. In the dim light, the human skulls perched atop the central pillars, crowned with half-melted candles, cast ghostly shadows across the room.</p>
<p>Kaelor, peering at the skulls, remarked with a wry smile, "Now, that's what I call mood lighting."</p>
<p>The vaulted ceiling, supported by several pillars, loomed ten feet above. Iron chandeliers and bronze candelabras dotted the space, their candles burning with flickering flames of purple, green, and octarine. A peculiar breeze stirred small dust devils, causing the candlelight to dance erratically.</p>
<p>As they ventured deeper, they encountered a peculiar sight: several mephits, elemental creatures of smoke, dust, and magma, lounging amidst the undercroft. The mephits had made this crypt their home.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/01-mephits.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/01-mephits.png" /></a></p>
<p>The dust mephit, swirling in a cloud of grit, spoke first in a raspy voice, "Ah, fleshies! Come to pay the toll?"</p>
<p>Grekson, understanding their primordial tongue, replied, "We're just passing through. No need for a toll."</p>
<p>The smoke mephit, its form wafting like tendrils of dark vapor, cackled. "No pass without pay! Gemstone for us, or trouble for you!"</p>
<p>Lord Eldrin, growing impatient with the exchange, stepped forward, his voice firm. "We will not be deterred by creatures such as you. This is a place of consecration, not for devils to play."</p>
<p>The magma mephit, glowing with inner heat, snarled, "Bold words, fleshie! Let's see if you burn as well as you bluster."</p>
<p>As the mephits prepared to attack, a sudden change came over Lord Eldrin. Divine flames, reflecting the sacred power of his faith, began to emanate from his armor. His eyes blazed with a righteous fury, and his voice boomed, "Enough! By the Sacred Flame, I command you to leave this hallowed ground!"</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/01-sacred-flame.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../images/01-sacred-flame.png" /></a></p>
<p>One of the smoke mephits dissipated instantly, consumed by the sacred flames, while the other two, the dust and smoke mephits, fled in terror, leaving the magma mephit cowering in the corner.</p>
<p>Kaelor, watching the scene unfold, quipped, "Well, that's one way to clear a room."</p>
<p>Tukuy, his gaze fixed on the retreating mephits, added, "Seems like the Sacred Flame burns brighter than we thought."</p>
<p>Grekson, amused by the turn of events, remarked, "And here I thought we'd have to negotiate."</p>
<p>Leaving the trembling magma mephit behind, the adventurers continued their exploration of the crypt, Lord Eldrin's divine anger still simmering beneath his calm exterior. The presence of the mephits, while momentarily unsettling, had only strengthened their resolve to uncover the secrets of the undercroft and the Chapel of Saint Brenna.</p>
